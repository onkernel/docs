title: "Logs"

After you [invoke](/launch/invoke) an action via the CLI, you can stream the invocation's logs in real time to your terminal:

```bash
kernel logs <app_name> --follow
```

If you don't specify `--follow`, the logs will print to the terminal until 3 seconds of inactivity and then stops.

See the [CLI reference](/reference/cli) for full details.
