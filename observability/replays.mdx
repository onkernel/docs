Replays show you exactly what happened in the browser window while a browser was live and active. It is generated as an MP4 file and available via URL.

Replays start when you connect to the browser via CDP.

Replays end when the browser is destroyed.

- For non-persistent browsers (which is the default **unless** you specify [persistence](/launch/browser-persistence)), the browser is destroyed when you call `browser.close()`.

- For persistent browsers, the browser is destroyed when you call `client.browsers.delete()`.

<Info>
    Use non-persistent browsers if you want to generate a replay for every invocation.
