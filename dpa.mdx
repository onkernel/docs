originating in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland is transferred to Kernel in the United States, 
the parties agree that such transfers shall be governed by the EU Commission 
Standard Contractual Clauses (Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914), 
which are hereby incorporated by reference.

use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate and cooperate with Customer concerning its responses

data ingested by Customer into the Service. Accordingly, it would be unlikely that the notice provided by
Kernel would include information concerning the categories and approximate number of data subjects
concerned and/or the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned. Kernel's
notification of a Personal Data Breach and its communication and cooperation with Customer concerning an
Personal Data Breach shall not be construed as an acknowledgment of fault or liability by Kernel.

Customer Personal Data within the Service, Kernel shall, taking into account the nature of the
processing, provide reasonable cooperation to assist Customer to respond to any requests from
individuals or applicable data protection authorities relating to the processing of Customer Personal Data
under the Agreement. If any such request is made to Kernel directly, Kernel shall not respond to
such communication directly without Customer's prior authorization, unless legally compelled to do so. If
Kernel is required to respond to such a request, Kernel shall promptly notify Customer and
provide it with a copy of the request unless legally prohibited from doing so.

8.2 Data Impact Assessments. To the extent Kernel is required under applicable European Data
Protection Law, Kernel shall provide reasonably requested information regarding Kernel's
processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement to assist the Customer to carry out data
protection impact assessments or prior consultations with supervisory authorities as required by law.

8.3 Third Party Demands. If Kernel receives a demand from a third party (including, without limitation,
any governmental, regulatory or supervisory authority) to retain, disclose or transfer Customer Personal
Data, Kernel shall use commercially reasonable efforts to direct the demanding party to Customer
and Customer authorizes Kernel to disclose such information to such third party as may be
reasonably necessary to direct the third party to Customer. Where Kernel is unable to direct the
demanding party to Customer, Kernel shall, to the extent legally permitted, provide Customer notice
of the demand and cooperate with Customer, at the Customer's cost and expense, in seeking a protective
order, or confidential treatment, or taking other measures to oppose or limit such demand.

restrictions set forth in the Agreement, including the damages disclaimer and any aggregate limitation of
liability.
