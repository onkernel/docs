## 2. Role of the Parties; Description of Processing

2.1 Except as expressly set forth in this DPA or the Agreement, with respect to Personal Data, Customer is the Controller and Kernel is a Processor, or to the extent Customer is a Processor to a third-party Controller, Kernel is a subprocessor.  

2.2 Kernel shall process Personal Data only (i) for purposes set forth in the Agreement, (ii) in a manner consistent with the documented instructions provided by Customer, which shall include the Agreement and this DPA, and (iii) as required by Privacy Laws or a supervisory authority; in such case, Kernel shall inform Customer of that legal requirement before processing to the extent legally permitted. The subject matter, nature, purpose, and duration of this processing, as well as the types of Personal Data collected and categories of Data Subjects involved, are described in Exhibit A to this DPA.  

## 3. Compliance with Privacy Laws

Customer shall, in its use of the Services, at all times process Personal Data, and provide instructions for the processing of Personal Data, in compliance with Privacy Laws. Customer shall ensure that the processing of Personal Data in accordance with Customer's instructions will not cause Kernel to be in breach of the Privacy Laws. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of (i) the Personal Data provided to Kernel by or on behalf of Customer, (ii) the means by which Customer acquired any such Personal Data, and (iii) the instructions it provides to Kernel regarding the processing of such Personal Data. Customer shall not provide or make available to Kernel any Personal Data in violation of the Agreement or otherwise inappropriate for the nature of the Services, and shall indemnify Kernel from all claims and losses in connection therewith. Kernel shall immediately notify Customer if an instruction, in Kernel's opinion, infringes Privacy Laws or instruction of a supervisory authority.  

## 4. Use of Personal Data

Kernel shall not: (i) sell or share Personal Data; (ii) retain, use, or disclose Personal Data outside of Kernel's direct business relationship with Customer or for any purpose other than for a business purpose under the CCPA on behalf of Customer or as necessary to perform the Services for Customer pursuant to the Agreement, except as otherwise permitted in Agreement or by Privacy Laws; and (iii) combine Personal Data received from, or on behalf of, Customer with Personal Data that it receives from, or on behalf of, another party or person, except as necessary to provide the Services or as otherwise instructed by Customer.  

## 5. Audit

5.1 Kernel shall maintain records sufficient to demonstrate its compliance with its obligations under this DPA. Upon Customer's written request at reasonable intervals, and subject to reasonable confidentiality controls, Kernel shall, either (i) make available for Customer's review copies of certifications or reports demonstrating Kernel's compliance with prevailing data security standards applicable to the processing of Personal Data, or (ii) if the provision of reports or certifications pursuant to (i) is not reasonably sufficient under Privacy Laws, allow Customer's independent third party representative to conduct an audit or inspection of Kernel's data security infrastructure and procedures that is sufficient to demonstrate Kernel's compliance with its obligations under Privacy Laws, provided that (a) Customer provides reasonable prior written notice of any such request for an audit and such inspection shall not be unreasonably disruptive to Kernel's business; (b) such audit shall only be performed during business hours and occur no more than once per calendar year; and (c) such audit shall be restricted to data relevant to Customer. Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any such audits or inspections, including without limitation a reimbursement to Kernel for any time expended for on-site audits. If Customer and Kernel have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 9 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the audits described in Clause 8.9 of the EU SCCs shall be carried out in accordance with this Section 5.2.  

## 6. Authorized Subprocessors

6.1 Customer acknowledges and agrees that Kernel may (1) engage its Affiliates as well as the Authorized Subprocessors listed in Exhibit B to this DPA to access and process Personal Data in connection with the Services and (2) from time to time engage additional third parties for the purpose of providing the Services, including without limitation the processing of Personal Data pursuant to Section 6.2. By way of this DPA, Customer provides general written authorization to Kernel to engage subprocessors as necessary to perform the Services.  

6.2 A list of Kernel's current Authorized Subprocessors (the “List”) will be made available to Customer, either attached hereto, at a link provided to Customer, via email or through another means made available to Customer. Such List may be updated by Kernel from time to time. Kernel may provide a mechanism to subscribe to notifications of new Authorized Subprocessors and Customer agrees to subscribe to such notifications where available. At least ten (10) days before enabling any third party other than existing Authorized Subprocessors to access or participate in the processing of Personal Data, Kernel will add such third party to the List and notify Customer via email. Customer may object to such an engagement by informing Kernel within ten (10) days of receipt of the aforementioned notice to Customer, provided such objection is in writing and based on reasonable grounds relating to data protection. If Customer does not object during this period, that third party will be deemed an Authorized Subprocessor. Customer acknowledges that certain subprocessors are essential to providing the Services and that objecting to the use of a subprocessor may prevent Kernel from offering the Services to Customer.  

6.3 If Customer reasonably objects to an engagement in accordance with Section 6.2, and Kernel cannot provide a commercially reasonable alternative within a reasonable period of time, Customer may discontinue the use of the affected Service by providing written notice to Kernel. Discontinuation shall not relieve Customer of any fees owed to Kernel under the Agreement.  

6.4 Kernel will enter into a written agreement with the Authorized Subprocessor imposing on the Authorized Subprocessor data protection obligations comparable to those imposed on Kernel under this DPA with respect to the protection of Personal Data. In case an Authorized Subprocessor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement with Kernel, Kernel will remain liable to Customer for the performance of the Authorized Subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.  

6.5 If Customer and Kernel have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 9 (Transfers of Personal Data), (i) the above authorizations will constitute Customer's prior written consent to the subcontracting by Kernel of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) the parties agree that the copies of the agreements with Authorized Subprocessors that must be provided by Kernel to Customer pursuant to Clause 9(c) of the EU SCCs may have commercial information, or information unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent, removed by Kernel beforehand, and that such copies will be provided by Kernel only upon request by Customer.  

## 7. Confidentiality; Security of Personal Data

7.1 Kernel shall ensure that any person it authorizes to process Personal Data has agreed to protect Personal Data in accordance with Kernel's confidentiality obligations in the Agreement. Customer agrees that Kernel may disclose Personal Data to its advisers, auditors or other third parties as reasonably required to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws and this DPA, subject to confidentiality obligations in accordance with this DPA.  

7.2 Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, Kernel shall maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing Personal Data, as described in Exhibit C.  

## 8. Personal Data Breach

8.1 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Kernel shall, without undue delay, inform Customer of the Personal Data Breach and take such steps as Kernel in its sole discretion deems necessary and reasonable to remediate such Personal Data Breach, to the extent that remediation is within Kernel's reasonable control.  

8.2 In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Kernel shall, taking into account the nature of the processing and the information available to Kernel, provide Customer with reasonable cooperation and assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations under Privacy Laws with respect to notifying (i) the relevant supervisory authority or regulatory agency and (ii) Data Subjects affected by such Personal Data Breach without undue delay.  

8.3 The obligations described in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 shall not apply in the event that a Personal Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Customer. Kernel's obligation to report or respond to a Personal Data Breach under Sections 8.1 and 8.2 will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Kernel of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.  

## 9. Transfers of Personal Data

9.1 The parties agree that Kernel may transfer Personal Data processed under this DPA outside the EEA, the UK, or Switzerland as necessary to provide the Services. Customer acknowledges that Kernel's primary processing operations take place in the United States, and that the transfer of Personal Data to the United States is necessary for the provision of the Services to Customer. If Kernel transfers Personal Data protected under this DPA to a jurisdiction for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, Kernel will ensure that appropriate safeguards have been implemented for the transfer of Personal Data in accordance with Privacy Laws.  

9.2 Ex-EEA Transfers

The Parties agree that ex-EEA Transfers shall either be made pursuant to (i) the Data Privacy Framework to the extent the recipient of the ex-EEA Transfer is certified accordingly, or (ii) the EU SCCs, which are deemed entered into (and incorporated herein by reference) and completed as follows:  

9.2.1 **Module One (Controller to Controller)** of the EU SCCs applies when Kernel is processing Personal Data as a controller pursuant to Section 9 of this DPA.  

9.2.2 **Module Two (Controller to Processor)** of the EU SCCs applies when Customer is a controller and Kernel is a processor of Personal Data in accordance with Section 2 of this DPA.  

9.2.3 **Module Three (Processor to Subprocessor)** of the EU SCCs applies when Customer is a processor and Kernel is a subprocessor of Personal Data in accordance with Section 2 of this DPA.  

9.3 For each module, the following applies:  

9.3.1 The optional docking clause in Clause 7 does not apply.  

9.3.2 In Clause 9, Option 1 (general written authorization) applies, and the minimum time period for prior notice of subprocessor changes shall be as set forth in Section 6.1 of this DPA.  

9.3.3 In Clause 11, the optional language does not apply.  

9.3.4 All square brackets in Clause 13 are hereby removed.  

9.3.5 In Clause 17 (Option 1), the EU SCCs will be governed by the laws of the Republic of Ireland.  

9.3.6 In Clause 18(b), disputes will be resolved before the courts of the Republic of Ireland.  

9.3.7 Exhibit B to this DPA contains the information required in Annex I of the EU SCCs.  

9.3.8 Exhibit C to this DPA contains the information required in Annex II of the EU SCCs.  

9.3.9 By entering into this DPA, the Parties are deemed to have signed the EU SCCs incorporated herein, including their Annexes.  

9.4 Ex-UK Transfers

The Parties agree that ex-UK Transfers shall either be made pursuant to (i) the Data Privacy Framework to the extent that recipient of the ex-UK Transfer is certified accordingly, or (ii) the UK SCCs, which are deemed entered into and incorporated herein by reference. The UK Addendum (including the EU SCCs incorporated into it) is (1) governed by the laws of England and Wales and (2) any dispute arising from it is resolved by the courts of England and Wales.  

9.5 Transfers from Switzerland

The Parties agree that transfers from Switzerland shall either be made pursuant to (i) the Data Privacy Framework to the extent that recipient of the transfer from Switzerland is certified accordingly, or (ii) the EU SCCs with the following modifications:  

9.5.1 The terms “General Data Protection Regulation” or “Regulation (EU) 2016/679” as utilized in the EU SCCs shall be interpreted to include the Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (the “FADP,” and as revised as of 25 September 2020, the “Revised FADP”) with respect to data transfers subject to the FADP.

9.5.2 Clause 13 of the EU SCCs is modified to provide that the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (“FDPIC”) of Switzerland shall have authority over data transfers governed by the FADP and the appropriate EU supervisory authority shall have authority over data transfers governed by the GDPR. Subject to the foregoing, all other requirements of Clause 13 shall be observed.

9.5.3 The term “EU Member State” as utilized in the EU SCCs shall not be interpreted in such a way as to exclude Data Subjects in Switzerland from exercising their rights in their place of habitual residence in accordance with Clause 18(c) of the EU SCCs. 

9.6 Supplementary Measures

In respect of any transfer of Personal Data made pursuant to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the following supplementary measures shall apply:  

9.6.1 As of the date of this DPA, Kernel has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service/agencies in the country to which the Personal Data is being exported, for access to (or for copies of) such Personal Data (“Government Agency Requests”).  

9.6.2 If Kernel receives a Government Agency Request, Kernel shall attempt to redirect the government agency to Customer. As part of this effort, Kernel may provide Customer's basic contact information to the government agency. If Kernel is compelled to disclose Personal Data, to the extent legally permitted, Kernel shall notify Customer of the demand and reasonably cooperate to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Kernel shall not voluntarily disclose Personal Data to any law enforcement or government agency. The Parties shall determine whether all or any transfers of Personal Data pursuant to this DPA should be suspended in light of such a Government Agency Request.

9.6.3 The Parties will confer as appropriate to consider whether: (i) the protection afforded by the laws of the country of Kernel to data subjects whose Personal Data is being transferred is sufficient to provide broadly equivalent protection to that afforded in the EEA or the UK, as applicable; (ii) additional measures are reasonably necessary for the transfer to comply with Privacy Laws; and (iii) it is still appropriate for Personal Data to be transferred to the relevant Kernel, taking into account all relevant information available, including guidance by supervisory authorities, to the Parties.

9.6.4 If either (i) any of the means of legitimizing a transfer cease to be valid or (ii) any supervisory authority requires transfers of Personal Data pursuant to those means to be suspended, the Parties agree to amend the means of legitimizing transfers in accordance with Privacy Laws. To the extent necessary to ensure the enforceability of the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Parties shall execute the Standard Contractual Clauses as a separate agreement.

## 10. Data Protection Assessments

Taking into account the nature of Kernel's processing and the information available to Kernel, Kernel shall reasonably cooperate with Customer to conduct any data protection or privacy impact assessments as required by Privacy Laws, including by providing Customer with information and documents necessary for such assessments that Customer cannot otherwise obtain without Kernel's assistance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer and Kernel each remain responsible only for the measures respectively allocated to them under Privacy Laws pertaining to any such assessment.

## 11. Data Subject Request

11.1 Kernel shall, to the extent permitted by Privacy Laws, notify Customer upon receipt of Data Subject Request. If Kernel receives a Data Subject Request in relation to Personal Data, Kernel will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request, including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Services. Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that Data Subject Requests are communicated to Kernel, and, if applicable, for ensuring that a record of consent to processing is maintained with respect to each Data Subject.

11.2 Kernel shall, at the request of Customer, and taking into account the nature of the processing applicable to any Data Subject Request, apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to assist Customer in complying with Customer's obligation to respond to such Data Subject Request and/or in demonstrating such compliance, where possible, provided that (i) Customer is itself unable to respond without Kernel's assistance and (ii) Kernel is able to do so in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Customer shall be responsible to the extent legally permitted for any costs and expenses arising from any such assistance by Kernel.

## 12. Return or Destruction of Personal Data

Upon the termination or expiration of the Agreement, at Customer's choice, Kernel shall return or delete Personal Data, unless further storage of such Personal Data is required or authorized by applicable law. If return or destruction is impracticable or prohibited by law, rule or regulation, Kernel shall take measures to block such Personal Data from any further processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or processing required by law, rule or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control. If Customer and Kernel have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 9 (Transfers of Personal Data), the parties agree that the certification of deletion of Personal Data that is described in  Clause 8.1(d) and Clause 8.5 of the EU SCCs (as applicable) shall be provided by Kernel to Customer only upon Customer's request.

## 13. Kernel's Role as a Controller

The parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to Kernel Account Data and Kernel Usage Data, Kernel is an independent controller, not a joint controller with Customer. Kernel will process Kernel Account Data and Kernel Usage Data as a controller (i) to manage the relationship with Customer; (ii) to carry out Kernel's core business operations, such as accounting, audits, tax preparation and filing and compliance purposes; (iii) to monitor, investigate, prevent and detect fraud, security incidents and other misuse of the Services, and to prevent harm to Customer; (iv) for identity verification purposes; (v) to comply with legal or regulatory obligations applicable to the processing and retention of Personal Data to which Kernel is subject; and (vi) as otherwise permitted under Privacy Laws and in accordance with this DPA and the Agreement. Kernel may also process Kernel Usage Data as a controller to provide, optimize, and maintain the Services, to the extent permitted by Privacy Laws. Any processing by Kernel as a controller shall be in accordance with Kernel's privacy policy.

## 14. Miscellaneous

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence will be: (1) the applicable terms in the Standard Contractual Clauses; (2) the terms of this DPA; (3) the Agreement, and (4) Kernel's privacy policy. Any claims brought in connection with this DPA will be subject to the Agreement, including, but not limited to, the exclusions and limitations set forth in the Agreement.
