title: "Build Fast!"
---

Kernel fundamentally changes how you develop cloud applications with a simple principle: deploy to production in the same time it takes to run locally.

Our [platform](/build/develop) eliminates the traditional gap between development and production environments:

- Test changes in a production environment as quickly as you would locally
- Rapidly iterate on features without waiting for long build and deploy cycles
- Eliminate the "works on my machine" problem by testing in the same environment where your code will run
- Share working versions instantly

This approach lets you maintain the speed and flow of local development while gaining all the benefits of cloud deployment. The best part is that all of this happens without you needing to configure Kubernetes, manage Docker containers, or wrangle AWS. We handle the infrastructure.
