## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Browser Automation

Both support Playwright and Puppeteer over CDP with identical APIs.

**Kernel:**
- Pre-warmed browser pool (&lt;1s cold start)
- Headless and headful modes
- Supports all CDP-based frameworks

**Browserbase:**
- Fast cold starts (~1-2s)
- Headless only
- Supports Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium

**Winner:** Tie for basic automation. Both are fast and reliable.

### Network Interception

Both support full network interception via CDP.

**Kernel:**
```typescript
await page.route('**/*', route => {
  if (route.request().resourceType() === 'image') {
    return route.abort();
  }
  return route.continue();
});
```

**Browserbase:**
```typescript
// Identical API
await page.route('**/*', route => {
  if (route.request().resourceType() === 'image') {
    return route.abort();
  }
  return route.continue();
});
```

**Winner:** Tie. Both support the full Playwright network API.

### Session Persistence

**Kernel:**
- Persist sessions for hours or days
- Standby mode: Zero cost when idle, instant wake
- Profiles: Save/load cookies globally

```typescript
const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({
  persistent: true,
  persistent_id: 'my-session'
});
// Goes to standby after 1min idle (free)
// Wakes in &lt;1s on next request
```

**Browserbase:**
- Context persistence (save cookies, storage between sessions)
- Sessions can last hours
- No standby mode (session must be explicitly kept alive)

**Winner:** Kernel. Standby mode provides zero-cost persistence.

### Live View & Debugging

**Kernel:**
- Built-in live view via VNC over WebRTC
- Watch browser in real-time from any browser
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Interactive debugging

```typescript
const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({ headless: false });
console.log('Live view:', kb.browser_live_view_url);
// Open URL in browser, watch automation live
```

**Browserbase:**
- No live view
- Debug via screenshots and logs

**Winner:** Kernel. Live view is a significant advantage for debugging and HITL workflows.

### Video Replays

**Kernel:**
- Full MP4 video recordings
- Capture entire session or segments
- Programmatic start/stop
- Download or stream

**Browserbase:**
- Screenshots at intervals
- Debug logs and traces
- Not full video

**Winner:** Kernel. Full video is better for debugging complex issues.

### Vercel Integration

**Kernel:**
- Native Vercel Marketplace integration
- One-click install
- Auto-provision API keys
- QA deployment checks (run tests on every preview/prod deploy)
- Managed via Vercel dashboard

**Browserbase:**
- Manual environment variable setup
- No marketplace integration
- No deployment checks

**Winner:** Kernel. Significantly better Vercel experience.

### File I/O

**Kernel:**
- Read/write files during session via API
- List directory contents
- Download files mid-automation
- Upload files to browser

```typescript
const files = await kernel.browsers.files.list(sessionId, '/downloads');
const content = await kernel.browsers.files.read(sessionId, files[0].path);
```

**Browserbase:**
- File access limited
- Downloads available after session (via API)

**Winner:** Kernel. More flexible for file operations.

### App Platform

**Kernel:**
- Deploy full applications (not just scripts)
- Invoke via API, webhooks, cron
- No timeout limits
- Environment variables, secrets
- Streaming logs

```bash
kernel deploy index.ts
kernel invoke app-name action-name --payload '{"url": "..."}'
```

**Browserbase:**
- Browser infrastructure only
- No app hosting

**Winner:** Kernel. Unique capability.

### Stealth & Anti-Detection

**Kernel:**
- Built-in stealth mode
- Automatic reCAPTCHA solver
- 4 proxy types: mobile, residential, ISP, datacenter
- Custom proxy support

**Browserbase:**
- Stealth configuration available
- Custom proxy support
- CAPTCHA solving via third-party

**Winner:** Kernel. Built-in CAPTCHA solver is a time-saver.

### Pricing

**Kernel:**
- Per-minute of active browser time
- Headless: ~$0.05/min
- Headful: ~$0.10/min
- Standby: Free
- No session fees

Example: 1,000 scrapes @ 3s each = 50 minutes = $2.50

**Browserbase:**
- Per-session + duration
- Pricing based on usage tiers
- Context persistence may incur additional charges

Example: Varies by plan, generally $0.01-0.05 per session + duration

**Winner:** Depends on use case. Kernel better for many short tasks. Browserbase competitive for longer sessions.

### Open Source

**Kernel:**
- Fully open source platform
- Self-hosting guide available
- Community contributions

**Browserbase:**
- Proprietary (closed source)
- Client SDKs open source

**Winner:** Kernel. Full transparency.

- Need full video replays for debugging
- Want to deploy full applications (not just scripts)
- Need session persistence with zero idle cost
- Prefer open-source platforms
- Need built-in CAPTCHA solving
- Want to self-host in the future

### Choose Browserbase if you:

- Already invested in Browserbase infrastructure
- Prefer a managed-only solution

- Are comfortable with proprietary solutions

## Migration from Browserbase to Kernel

Minimal code changes:

```typescript
// Before (Browserbase)
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP({
  wsEndpoint: `wss://connect.browserbase.com?apiKey=${BROWSERBASE_KEY}`
});

// After (Kernel)
const kernel = new Kernel({ apiKey: process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY });
const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({ headless: true });
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP({
  wsEndpoint: kb.cdp_ws_url
});
```

Everything else remains the same.

## Real-World Comparison

### Scenario 1: Vercel App with Preview QA

**Task:** Run E2E tests on every preview deployment.

**With Kernel:**
- Install from Vercel Marketplace
- Configure QA checks in dashboard
- Tests run automatically on every deploy
- Video replays available for failures

**With Browserbase:**
- Manual GitHub Actions setup
- Configure environment variables
- Trigger tests via workflow
- Debug with screenshots only

**Winner:** Kernel. Automated QA checks save setup time.

### Scenario 2: Long-Running Scraping Job

**Task:** Scrape 10,000 products over 2 hours.

**With Kernel:**
- Use persistent session with standby
- Session stays alive, goes idle between batches
- Pay only for active scraping time
- Can watch progress via live view

**With Browserbase:**
- Keep session alive for duration
- Pay for full session time
- No live view

**Winner:** Depends. Kernel saves on idle time; Browserbase may be simpler for always-active scraping.

### Scenario 3: Debugging Flaky Test

**Task:** Figure out why a test fails intermittently.

**With Kernel:**
- Enable video replays
- Run test repeatedly
- Watch full video of failure
- See exact moment and state

**With Browserbase:**
- Enable debug mode
- Review screenshots and logs
- Infer failure from snapshots

**Winner:** Kernel. Video is more informative than screenshots.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Connection Pattern

Both use identical connection patterns:

```typescript
// Both support this
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP({
  wsEndpoint: cdpWebSocketUrl
});

const page = browser.contexts()[0].pages()[0];
await page.goto('https://example.com');
```

### Session Management

**Kernel:**
```typescript
// Create persistent session
const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({
  persistent: true,
  persistent_id: 'user-123'
});

// Reuse later
const existing = browsers.find(b => b.persistent_id === 'user-123');
```

**Browserbase:**
```typescript
// Create session with context
const session = await browserbase.createSession({
  projectId: 'proj-123',
  persistContext: true
});

// Reuse context
const session2 = await browserbase.createSession({
  projectId: 'proj-123',
  contextId: session.contextId
});
```

Similar concepts, different APIs.

## FAQ

### Can Kernel replace Browserbase in my stack?

Yes. Both use CDP, so Playwright/Puppeteer code is identical. Main changes are initialization and session management.

### Which is faster?

Both have fast cold starts (&lt;2s). Kernel is slightly faster with pre-warmed pools (&lt;1s).

### Which is more reliable?

Both are production-grade. Browserbase has longer track record at scale. Kernel is newer but fully open source.

### Can I use both?

Yes. Both connect via CDP WebSocket. Use Kernel for Vercel deployments and Browserbase for other workloads if desired.

### Does Browserbase have live view?

No. Browserbase doesn't offer live view. Use screenshots and logs for debugging.

### Does Kernel support Browserbase's SDK?

No. Kernel has its own SDK (`@onkernel/sdk`). But since both use CDP, the Playwright/Puppeteer code is identical.

## Pricing Comparison (Real Example)

**Use case:** Screenshot 5,000 product pages monthly.

### Kernel
```
5,000 pages × 2 seconds = 167 minutes
167 minutes × $0.05/min (headless) = $8.35/month
```

### Browserbase
```
5,000 sessions × $0.02/session (estimated) = $100/month
```

**Winner for this use case:** Kernel (significantly cheaper for short tasks).

**Use case:** Continuous monitoring (24/7 browser).

### Kernel
```
1 browser × 43,200 minutes × $0.05/min = $2,160/month
(Or use standby mode for idle periods)
```

### Browserbase
```
1 session × flat monthly rate = $200-500/month (varies)
```

**Winner for this use case:** Browserbase (better for always-on scenarios).
