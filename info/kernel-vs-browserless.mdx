## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Browser Automation

Both support Playwright and Puppeteer over CDP. Identical functionality for page navigation, selectors, and basic automation.

**Kernel:**
- Supports Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium (via CDP), Stagehand, Browser Use, Computer Use APIs
- Pre-warmed browser pool (&lt;1s cold start)
- Headless and headful modes

**Browserless:**
- Supports Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium
- On-demand browser launch (~2-5s)
- Headless only (headful deprecated)

**Winner:** Tie for basic automation. Kernel has faster cold starts.

### Network Interception

Both support full network interception via CDP.

**Kernel:**
```typescript
await page.route('**/*', route => {
  if (route.request().resourceType() === 'image') {
    return route.abort();
  }
  return route.continue();
});
```

**Browserless:**
```typescript
await page.route('**/*', route => {
  if (route.request().resourceType() === 'image') {
    return route.abort();
  }
  return route.continue();
});
```

Identical API. No difference.

**Winner:** Tie.

### Session Persistence

**Kernel:**
- Persist sessions for hours or days
- Standby mode: Zero cost when idle, instant wake
- Profiles: Save/load cookies, auth state across sessions

```typescript
const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({
  persistent: true,
  persistent_id: 'my-session'
});
// Session stays alive, goes to standby after 1min idle
// Reuse in next request for instant auth
```

**Browserless:**
- Sessions tied to active connection
- Can keep alive with keep-alive tokens
- No standby mode (always consuming resources)

**Winner:** Kernel. More flexible persistence with zero idle cost.

### Live View & Debugging

**Kernel:**
- Built-in live view (VNC over WebRTC)
- Watch browser in real-time from web browser
- Useful for human-in-the-loop workflows, debugging

**Browserless:**
- No live view (headful mode deprecated in v2)
- Debug via logs only

**Winner:** Kernel.

### Video Replays

**Kernel:**
- Full MP4 video recordings
- Start/stop programmatically
- Useful for debugging, compliance, auditing

**Browserless:**
- No replay feature

**Winner:** Kernel.

### Vercel Integration

**Kernel:**
- Native integration via Vercel Marketplace
- One-click install
- Auto-provision API keys
- QA deployment checks on every preview/production deploy
- Configuration management via Vercel dashboard

**Browserless:**
- Manual setup (environment variables)
- No deployment checks
- No marketplace integration

**Winner:** Kernel. Significantly easier for Vercel users.

### File I/O

**Kernel:**
- Read/write files during session via API
- Access downloads mid-session
- Upload files to browser filesystem

```typescript
const files = await kernel.browsers.files.list(sessionId, '/downloads');
const content = await kernel.browsers.files.read(sessionId, file.path);
```

**Browserless:**
- Files only available after session ends
- Must wait for session to complete

**Winner:** Kernel. More flexible for file operations.

### Stealth & Anti-Detection

**Kernel:**
- Built-in stealth mode
- Automatic reCAPTCHA solver
- 4 proxy types (mobile, residential, ISP, datacenter)
- Custom proxy support

**Browserless:**
- Stealth plugins available
- CAPTCHA solving via integrations (2Captcha, etc.)
- Custom proxy support

**Winner:** Kernel. Built-in CAPTCHA solver saves setup time.

### Pricing

**Kernel:**
- Per-minute of active browser time
- Headless: ~$0.05/min
- Headful: ~$0.10/min
- Standby mode: Free
- No session fees

Example: 1,000 scrapes @ 3s each = 50 minutes = $2.50

**Browserless:**
- Per-session + duration
- Pricing tiers based on concurrency
- Session-based charging (even if browser idle)

Example: 1,000 sessions = varies by plan (~$0.01-0.05/session + duration)

**Winner:** Depends on use case. Kernel better for short, frequent tasks. Browserless better for long-running sessions if you optimize for concurrency.

### Open Source

**Kernel:**
- Fully open source (browser infrastructure, API, dashboard)
- Self-hosting guide available
- Community contributions welcome

**Browserless:**
- Client libraries open source
- Server/infrastructure proprietary

**Winner:** Kernel. Full platform transparency.

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Kernel if you:

- Need Vercel integration with QA deployment checks
- Want human-in-the-loop (live view)
- Need video replays for debugging/compliance
- Want session persistence with zero idle cost
- Need file I/O during session
- Prefer open-source platforms
- Run many short automation tasks

### Choose Browserless if you:

- Have existing Browserless integration (migration cost)
- Need maximum concurrency (1000+ simultaneous browsers)
- Prefer session-based pricing for long-running tasks
- Already familiar with their API

## Migration from Browserless to Kernel

Minimal code changes required:

```typescript
// Before (Browserless)
const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: `wss://chrome.browserless.io?token=${TOKEN}`
});

// After (Kernel)
const kernel = new Kernel({ apiKey: process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY });
const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({ headless: true });
const browser = await puppeteer.connect({
  browserWSEndpoint: kb.cdp_ws_url
});
```

Everything else (selectors, actions, tests) remains identical.

## Real-World Comparison

### Scenario 1: Generate OG Images on Vercel

**Task:** Generate social preview images for blog posts.

**With Kernel:**
- Install from Vercel Marketplace (1 click)
- API key auto-provisioned
- Deploy Next.js API route
- &lt;1s cold start, 2s total per image

**With Browserless:**
- Manually add API key to Vercel
- Configure connection
- Deploy Next.js API route
- ~3-5s per image (slower cold start)

**Winner:** Kernel. Easier setup, faster execution.

### Scenario 2: Monitor Competitor Prices (Cron Job)

**Task:** Scrape 100 competitor prices every hour.

**With Kernel:**
- Use persistent session with profile
- First run: logs in, saves cookies
- Subsequent runs: instant auth, scrape
- Cost: ~5 min/day = $0.50/day = $15/month

**With Browserless:**
- Log in on each run (no long-term persistence)
- Must re-auth every time
- Cost: ~100 sessions/day = varies by plan

**Winner:** Kernel. Persistence saves time and cost.

### Scenario 3: E2E Testing (CI/CD)

**Task:** Run Playwright tests on every PR.

**With Kernel:**
- Works with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
- Parallel test execution
- Video replays for failed tests
- Cost: Pay only for test duration

**With Browserless:**
- Works with CI/CD
- Parallel execution
- No video replays (screenshots only via Playwright)
- Cost: Per test session

**Winner:** Kernel. Video replays useful for debugging flaky tests.

## FAQ

### Can Kernel replace Browserless in my existing stack?

Yes. Kernel supports the same protocols (CDP) and frameworks (Playwright, Puppeteer). Migration typically takes &lt;1 hour.

### Does Kernel support the Browserless REST API?

No. Kernel uses a different API design focused on SDK-first usage. However, CDP connection works identically, so your Playwright/Puppeteer code doesn't change.

### Which is faster?

Kernel has faster cold starts (&lt;1s vs 2-5s) due to pre-warmed browser pools. Both have similar performance for page loads and automation once browser is running.

### Which is more reliable?

Both are production-grade. Kernel's standby mode reduces cold start issues for persistent sessions. Browserless has longer market presence.

### Can I use both?

Yes. Both connect via CDP WebSocket. You can use Kernel for Vercel deployments and Browserless for other workloads if desired.
