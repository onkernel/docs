title: "Browsers on Unikernels"

## Introduction

At Kernel, we've [pioneered](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43705144) a revolutionary approach to browser automation infrastructure: running Chromium browsers on lightweight unikernels. This architecture represents a significant departure from traditional solutions (warm pools / Kubernetes-orchestrated Docker containers), offering unique capabilities that set our platform apart.

## Technical architecture
Our platform consists of two key components:

1. **Your app code**: we host your app code on isolated unikernel instances, providing isolation and security.
2. **Browser runtime**: each app instance gets its own Chromium browser running on a dedicated Unikraft-based unikernel. Your app code connects to and runs alongside the browser in the cloud.

When you use our [app code](/apps/deploy) platform, we co-locate your browser automations scripts with the browser environment. This solves a number of issues that remote browsers have, including latency, errors due to unexpected disconnects, and bandwidth issues during data-intensive operations like screenshots.

## Unikernels and browsers

### Unikernels

Unikernels represent a fundamentally different approach to operating system design. Unlike traditional operating systems that include drivers, services, and components for general-purpose computing, unikernels are specialized, single-purpose systems that include only the necessary components to run a specific application.

### Browsers

Browsers are inherently designed to run untrusted code from the internet. To handle this safely, browser architectures incorporate sophisticated isolation mechanisms like sandboxing processes, separating rendering engines from JavaScript execution, and implementing strict security boundaries.

This existing security-focused architecture makes browsers exceptionally well-suited for unikernel deployments. While unikernels typically lack internal security boundaries, browsers compensate with their own robust isolation mechanisms. The browser's multi-process architecture and sandboxing capabilities effectively compensate for this limitation of unikernels.

By combining these technologies, we get the best of both worlds. The minimal attack surface and resource efficiency of unikernels, complemented by the browser's battle-tested security architecture designed specifically for handling untrusted content, creates an ideal environment for secure, efficient browser infrastructure.

## Capabilities

Our browsers-on-unikernels approach unlocks several capabilities unique to our platform:

### Intelligent standby mode

When your app isn't actively processing network traffic, our browsers automatically go into standby mode. This dramatically reduces resource consumption during idle periods.

Unlike traditional "sleep" states, our standby mode preserves the entire browser state while consuming negligible resources, allowing you to maintain long-running sessions without the associated costs.

### Persistent state through snapshots

One of the most powerful features of our approach is the ability to create complete snapshots of the browser's state when entering standby mode. These snapshots capture everything:

- Authentication cookies and session data
- Loaded page content and DOM state
- Browser window configuration and zoom level
- Local storage
- Active downloads and processes

When the browser needs to be reactivated, the Kernel platform restores from these snapshots in milliseconds, allowing you to pick up exactly where you left off.

### Sub-millisecond cold starts

Traditional browser infrastructure takes several seconds to initialize a new browser instance. Our unikernel-based approach achieves cold start times of less than 20 milliseconds.

This ultra-fast startup capability makes our platform ideal for event-driven scenarios where rapid response to triggers is essential. Your app can spring to life almost instantly when needed, then return to standby when idle.

## Use cases

Use our platform for anything that requires fast execution, low latency, or long-running browsers:

- Long-running browser automation tasks with intermittent activity
- Applications requiring browser state across invocations
- Event-driven scenarios demanding ultra-low latency response
- Resource-intensive browser automation at scale
- Security-critical browser automation where isolation is paramount
