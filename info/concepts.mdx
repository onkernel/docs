## App
An `App` is a codebase deployed on Kernel. You can use Kernel for a variety of use cases, including web automations, data processing, and more.

## Action
An `Action` is an invokable method within an app. Actions allow your to register entry points or functions that can be triggered on-demand. Actions can call non-action methods. Apps can have multiple actions.

## Invocation
An `Invocation` is a single execution of an action. Invocations can be triggered via API, scheduled as a job, or run on-demand.
