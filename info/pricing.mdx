title: "Pricing & Limits"
---

With Kernel, you only pay for what you use and nothing more. You don't pay for idle time thanks to [Standby Mode](/browsers/standby), and you're never charged for proxies. Our goal is to be cost-effective, scalable, and transparent.

## Reserved browsers (browser pools)

With Browser Pools, you pay the standard usage-based price per GB-second while browsers run, plus a small disk space charge when they are idle.

| | Headful | Headless |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Disk price per GB/hour | $0.001 | $0.001 |
| Disk allocation per browser | 4 GB | 1 GB |
| Example: 50 browsers idle/month | $144/month | $36/month |

> Note: Disk space charges are waived for Enterprise plan customers.

## Concurrency limits

| Feature | Developer (free + usage) | Hobbyist ($30 / mo + usage) | Start-Up ($200 / mo + usage) | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reserved browsers ([browser pools](/browsers/scaling/pools)) | 0 | 0 | 100 | Custom |
| On-demand browsers | 5 | 10 | 50 | Custom |
| Invocations | 5 | 10 | 50 | Custom |
| Invocations (per-app) | 5 | 10 | 20 | Custom |
| Managed auth profiles | N/A | 3 | 20 | Custom |

> Note: Limits are org-wide by default unless stated otherwise. `Managed auth profiles` refer to the number of active auth connections that Kernel maintains using your stored [Credentials](/profiles/credentials) or [1Password connection](/integrations/1password).

## Managed Auth billing

Managed Auth is included on all paid plans with no per-connection fees. Under the hood, it uses browser sessions to log in and keep your sessions fresh—these count toward your browser usage and concurrency like any other browser session.

Auth sessions are fast (typically 5-30 seconds each). Kernel monitors session health and re-authenticates automatically when sessions expire—most stay valid for days. For example, keeping 100 auth connections logged in typically costs less than $5/month in browser usage.
