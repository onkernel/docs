## Browser pools

Browser pools incur additional charges for disk space used by idle browsers in the pool.

**Price:** $0.001 per GB of disk per hour

**Disk allocation:**

- Headful browsers: 4 GB each
- Headless browsers: 1 GB each

**Examples:**

- A pool of 50 headful browsers sitting idle would add roughly **$144/month**.
- A pool of 50 headless browsers sitting idle would add about **$36/month**.

> Note: Browser pools are billed separately from usage-based pricing. Only idle browsers in pools incur disk space charges.
