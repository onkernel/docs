---

Should you use Kernel's managed browsers or self-host Chrome? This guide compares total cost, operational overhead, and helps you decide.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Kernel (Managed) | Self-Hosted Chrome |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Setup Time** | Minutes (sign up, get API key) | Days (Docker, orchestration, monitoring) |
| **Cold Start** | &lt;1s (pre-warmed pool) | 5-30s (container pull + Chrome launch) |
| **Scaling** | Automatic (1 to 1000+ browsers) | Manual (configure autoscaling, limits) |
| **Maintenance** | Zero (Chrome updates automatic) | Ongoing (security patches, Chrome updates) |
| **Infrastructure** | Managed globally | You provision & manage |
| **Cost (light use)** | $5-50/month typical | $50-200/month minimum (always-on) |
| **Cost (heavy use)** | $100-500/month | $500-2000/month (servers + ops time) |
| **Features** | Live view, replays, persistence, standby | What you build |
| **Control** | API-based configuration | Full control (custom flags, builds) |
| **Debugging** | Built-in (live view, replays, logs) | DIY (logs, VNC setup optional) |
| **Compliance** | Kernel's infrastructure | Your infrastructure (full control) |

## Detailed Comparison

### Setup & Time to First Browser

**Kernel:**

```
ECS Fargate (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM):
- Compute: 730 hours × $0.12/hr = $87.60/month
- Scaling overhead: 3 instances for peaks = $262.80/month

Operational overhead:
- Setup time: 20 hours @ $100/hr = $2,000 (one-time)
- Monthly maintenance: 4 hours @ $100/hr = $400/month
- Total monthly: $662.80/month
```

**Winner:** Self-hosted is cheaper at this scale.

#### Heavy Use: 5,000 browser-hours/month

**Kernel:**
```
5,000 hours = 300,000 minutes
300,000 minutes × $0.05/min = $15,000/month
```

**Self-Hosted on Kubernetes (GKE/EKS):**
```
Kubernetes cluster (10 nodes, autoscaling):
- Compute: ~$1,200/month (optimized)
- Load balancer: $20/month
- Monitoring (Datadog/New Relic): $200/month
- Container registry: $50/month

## Decision Framework

### Choose Kernel if:

- You're getting started with browser automation
- Ops time is expensive or unavailable
- You need fast cold starts (&lt;1s)
- You want zero maintenance burden
- You need advanced features (live view, replays, standby)
- Your usage is variable (spiky traffic)
- You use Vercel and want native integration
- You're automating &lt;2,000 browser-hours/month

### Choose Self-Hosting if:

- You have dedicated DevOps team
- Your usage is consistent and high (5,000+ hours/month)
- You need custom Chrome builds or flags
- You have strict data sovereignty requirements

- Serverless (pay per use)
- Auto-scaling
- Relatively simple

**Cons:**
- Cold starts (5-15s)
- Memory limits (8GB max)
- Not ideal for long-running browsers

**Cost:** ~$50/month minimum

### Docker on Fly.io

**Pros:**
- Global edge network
- Fast cold starts (3-5s)
- Simple deployment

**Cons:**
- Smaller scale than GCP/AWS
- Less mature than Cloud Run

**Cost:** ~$30/month minimum

### ECS Fargate (AWS)

**Pros:**
- No server management
- Integrates with AWS ecosystem
- Good for burst workloads

**Cons:**
- More expensive than EC2 for always-on
- Cold starts (10-15s)

**Cost:** ~$100/month minimum

### Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS)

**Pros:**
- Best for large scale
- Full control
- Advanced orchestration

**Cons:**
- Complex setup
- Requires Kubernetes expertise
- High minimum cost

**Cost:** ~$200/month minimum (cluster + nodes)

### Railway / Render

**Pros:**
- Simple deployment
- Good developer experience
- Affordable for small scale

**Cons:**
- Limited enterprise features
- Smaller scale than AWS/GCP

**Cost:** ~$20/month minimum

## Migration Patterns

### Start with Kernel, Migrate Later

```typescript
// Abstract browser creation
async function getBrowser() {
  if (process.env.USE_KERNEL) {
    const kernel = new Kernel({ apiKey: process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY });
    const kb = await kernel.browsers.create({ headless: true });
    return await chromium.connectOverCDP({ wsEndpoint: kb.cdp_ws_url });
  } else {
    return await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
  }
}

// Use same code in both environments
const browser = await getBrowser();
```

Deploy on Kernel initially. Once usage grows, flip to self-hosted.

### Hybrid: Kernel for Peaks, Self-Host for Baseline

```typescript
async function getBrowser() {
  const load = await getCurrentLoad();
  
  if (load > SELF_HOSTED_CAPACITY) {
    // Use Kernel for overflow
    return await connectToKernel();
  } else {
    // Use self-hosted for baseline
    return await connectToSelfHosted();
  }
}
```

Cost-optimize by using self-hosted for predictable load, Kernel for spikes.

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Startup Building MVP

**Need:** Scrape competitor data, generate OG images.

**Volume:** 100 browser-hours/month.

**Recommendation:** **Use Kernel.** Focus on product, not infrastructure. Total cost ~$300/month including ops time. Self-hosting would cost ~$250/month plus 10+ hours setup.

### Scenario 2: Mid-Size SaaS (E2E Testing)

**Need:** Run Playwright tests on every PR (500 PRs/month).

**Volume:** 300 browser-hours/month.

**Recommendation:** **Use Kernel.** Tests run faster (cold start &lt;1s). Zero ops burden. Cost ~$900/month. Self-hosting would be ~$500/month but adds maintenance burden.

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Web Scraping

**Need:** Scrape 100,000 pages/day continuously.

**Volume:** 10,000 browser-hours/month.

**Recommendation:** **Self-host on Kubernetes.** At this scale, infrastructure cost becomes dominant. Self-hosting costs ~$3,000/month vs Kernel's ~$30,000/month. ROI on DevOps investment is clear.

### Scenario 4: Regulatory/Compliance

**Need:** Financial data scraping with PII.

**Requirements:** Data cannot leave your infrastructure.

**Recommendation:** **Self-host** (or use Kernel open source to self-host the Kernel platform). Compliance trumps cost.

## TCO Calculator (5-Year)

### Kernel

```
Year 1: $3,600 (300 hours/month)
Year 2: $7,200 (600 hours/month, growing)
Year 3: $10,800 (900 hours/month)
Year 4: $14,400 (1,200 hours/month)
Year 5: $18,000 (1,500 hours/month)

Total 5-year: $54,000
Total ops time: 0 hours
```

### Self-Hosted

```
Setup: $4,000 (40 hours)
Year 1: $6,000 (infra) + $12,000 (ops) = $18,000
Year 2: $8,000 + $12,000 = $20,000
Year 3: $10,000 + $15,000 = $25,000
Year 4: $12,000 + $15,000 = $27,000
Year 5: $14,000 + $18,000 = $32,000

Total 5-year: $126,000
Total ops time: ~600 hours
```

**Winner:** Kernel at moderate scale. Self-hosted wins at very high scale (10,000+ hours/month) or with existing DevOps team.

## FAQ

### Can I self-host Kernel itself?

**Yes.** Kernel is fully open source. See [github.com/onkernel/kernel](https://github.com/onkernel/kernel) for self-hosting guide. You get Kernel's features on your infrastructure.

### What if I outgrow Kernel?

You can always migrate to self-hosted later. Kernel uses standard CDP, so your Playwright/Puppeteer code is portable.

### Is self-hosting more reliable?

Depends on your ops maturity. Kernel's infrastructure is battle-tested. Self-hosted can be equally reliable if you invest in monitoring, redundancy, and on-call.

### Can I start with Kernel and add self-hosted later?

Yes. Run both in parallel (Kernel for dev/test, self-hosted for prod) or use Kernel for overflow.

### What about vendor lock-in?

Kernel uses standard protocols (CDP, WebSocket). Your automation code is portable. Switching cost is minimal (mostly initialization code).
