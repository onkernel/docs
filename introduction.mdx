Kernel is a powerful serverless platform that enables developers to deploy and scale browser automations without worrying about infrastructure.

## Why use Kernel?

- **Local to production in seconds** - No configurations, no production pipelines. Deploy and run your code on our platform in the same amount of time it takes to type `bun run dev`.
- **Turn any agent into an API** - Kernel's platform turns every agent you write into an API that you can invoke from anywhere.
- **Parallel scaling** - Run thousands of concurrent browsers on-demand; we scale with you.
- **Securely isolated, easily observable** - Your code runs in isolated virtual machines, and we provide the tools you need to inspect and debug them.
- **Simple, predictable pricing** - Pay only for the resources you use, without pre-defining infrastructure requirements.

## Browser support

Our platform provides first-class support for browser-based workloads. For developers building web automations, AI agents, or any browser-dependent application, Kernel offers specialized capabilities:

- **Integrated browser environment** - Seamlessly create and interact with our cloud-based browsers on-demand
- **State persistence** - Maintain browser sessions across invocations, preserving cookies, auth tokens, and history
- **Standby mode** - Restart browser instances in 20 milliseconds or less
- **Live debugging** - View and interact with browser sessions in real-time
- **Replays** - Review past browser sessions for debugging and analysis

Our co-located architecture places your application code directly alongside the browser in the cloud, minimizing latency and connection issues common with other platforms. The best part is that all of this happens without you needing to configure Kubernetes, manage Docker containers, or wrangle AWS. We handle the infrastructure.
