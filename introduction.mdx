Kernel is a developer platform that provides Crazy Fast Browsers-as-a-Service for browser automations and web agents. Our API and MCP server allow you to instantly launch browsers in the cloud without managing infrastructure.

## Connect over CDP

If you are already familiar with browser vendors, you can immediately start using our browsers with `kernel.browsers.create()`. We return a **CDP url** that you can connect any Playwright or Puppeteer automation to.

<Info>
Install the Kernel SDK with `npm install @onkernel/sdk` or `uv pip install kernel`
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create();
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernelBrowser.cdp_ws_url);
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

kernel = Kernel()

kernel_browser = kernel.browsers.create()
async with async_playwright() as playwright:
    browser = await playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Kernel app platform

If you're new to building web agents or browser automations, our platform provides a full-featured code execution platform for hosting and invoking your automations in production. Follow our [quickstart guide](/quickstart#getting-started) to get started.

You can also use Kernel without installing anything in [our playground](https://dashboard.onkernel.com/playground).

## Why Kernel?

Developers love our platform for its performance, developer experience, and all the other niceties that would otherwise be impractical to homeroll yourself:

- **Serverless browsers** - Connect your web automation to our cloud-based browsers without managing infrastructure
- **Session state** - Securely reuse auth cookies and session state via [Profiles](/browsers/profiles). Browsers can run for up to 72 hours via [timeout configuration](/browsers/termination)
- **Live view** - Support human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Replays** - Review past browser sessions as video replays
- **Full isolation** - Kernel browsers are sandboxed in individual, isolated virtual machines
- **Parallel scaling** - Run hundreds or thousands of concurrent browsers at scale
- **Simple, predictable pricing** - We only charge for active browser time
