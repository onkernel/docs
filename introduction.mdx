Kernel is a powerful serverless platform that enables developers to deploy and scale browser automations without worrying about infrastructure.

- **Integrated browser environment** - Seamlessly create and connect your web agent to our cloud-based browsers on-demand
- **Parallel scaling** - Run concurrent browsers on-demand; we scale with you
- **Securely isolated** - Kernel browsers are sandboxed in individual isolated virtual machines
- **State persistence** - Maintain browser sessions across invocations, preserving cookies, auth tokens, and history
- **Live debugging** - View and interact with browser sessions in real-time using our Live View
- **Replays** - Review past browser session videos
- **Simple, predictable pricing** - Pay only for the resources you use without pre-defining infrastructure requirements

## How to use Kernel

There are two ways to use the Kernel platform:
### 1. Deploy and invoke your web agent on our platform

Kernel's platform allows you to to [deploy](/launch/deploy) your app's code to our cloud. This allows you to co-locate your browser automation or web agent directly alongside the browser it controls in the cloud, minimizing latency and connection issues common with other platforms.

Follow our [quickstart guide](/quickstart) to get started.

### 2. Connect to remote browsers via Chrome DevTools Protocol

For developers who already have browsers automations in production but want to use Kernel's cloud-based browsers, you can quickly spin up [remote browsers](/build/remote-browsers) and connect to them with the Chrome DevTools Protocol:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
const kernel = new Kernel();
const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create();
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernelBrowser.cdp_ws_url);
```

```python Python
import kernel
client = Kernel()
kernel_browser = client.browsers.create()
browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url)
```
