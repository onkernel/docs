Kernel is a developer platform that provides Crazy Fast Browser Infrastructure for browser automations and web agents. Our API and MCP server allow you to instantly launch browsers in the cloud without managing infrastructure.

## kernel.browsers.create()

If you are already familiar with browser vendors, you can immediately start using our browsers with `kernel.browsers.create()`. We return a CDP url that you can connect any Playwright or Puppeteer automation to.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
const kernel = new Kernel();
const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create();
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernelBrowser.cdp_ws_url);
```

```python Python
import kernel
client = Kernel()
kernel_browser = client.browsers.create()
browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url)
```

## Kernel app platform

If you're new to building web agents or browser automations, our platform provides a full-featured code execution platform for hosting and invoking your automations in production. Follow our [quickstart guide](/quickstart#getting-started) to get started.

## Why Kernel?

Developers love our platform for its performance, developer experience, and all the other niceties that would otherwise be impractical to homeroll yourself:

- **Serverless browsers** - Connect your web automation to our cloud-based browsers without managing infrastructure
- **Persistence** - Securely reuse auth cookies and session stateâ€”we offer multiple ways to reuse browser sessions across hours or days with minimal effort
- **Live view** - Support human-in-the-loop workflows
- **Replays** - Review past browser sessions as video replays
- **Full isolation** - Kernel browsers are sandboxed in individual, isolated virtual machines
- **Parallel scaling** - Run hundreds or thousands of concurrent browsers at scale
- **Simple, predictable pricing** - We only charge for active browser time
