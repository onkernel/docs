This Information Security Addendum (the “Addendum”) sets forth the technical and organizational measures for the protection of Content processed by Kernel (if applicable) or data (if any) provided by Customer to Kernel in connection with the delivery of Support Services (if applicable) (collectively “Customer Information”).

Kernel shall maintain an information security program that is designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Customer Information (the "Kernel Information Security Program"). The Kernel Information Security Program will be implemented on an organization-wide basis. The Kernel Information Security Program will be designed to ensure Kernel's compliance with data protection laws and regulations applicable to Kernel's performance under the applicable Agreement (including any Data Processing Addendum), and shall include the safeguards set below, which substantially conform to the ISO/IEC 27002 control framework (the “Kernel Information Security Controls”).

## 1. Audits and Certifications
