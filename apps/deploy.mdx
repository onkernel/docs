title: "Deploying"
---

Kernel's app deployment process is as simple as it is fast. There are no configuration files to manage or complex CI/CD pipelines.

Once you deploy an app on Kernel, you can schedule its actions on a job or run them from other contexts. You can even run actions multiple times in parallel.


## Deploy the app

Use our CLI from the root directory of your project:
```bash
# entrypoint_file_name should be where you've defined your Kernel app
kernel deploy <entrypoint_file_name>
```

## Environment variables

You can set environment variables for your app using the `--env` flag. For example:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Typescript/Javascript
kernel deploy my_app.ts --env MY_ENV_VAR=my_value # Can add multiple env vars delimited by space
```

```bash Python
kernel deploy my_app.py --env MY_ENV_VAR=my_value # Can add multiple env vars delimited by space
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deployment notes

- The `entrypoint_file_name` is the file name where you [defined](/apps/develop) your app.
- Include a `.gitignore` file to exclude dependency folders like `node_modules` and `.venv`.
- Kernel assumes the root directory contains at least this file structure:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Typescript/Javascript
project-root/
  ├─ .gitignore # Exclude dependency folders like node_modules
  ├─ my_app.ts # Entrypoint file
  ├─ package.json
  ├─ tsconfig.json # If using TypeScript
  └─ bun.lock | package-lock.json | pnpm-lock.yaml # One of these lockfiles
```

```bash Python
project-root/
  ├─ .gitignore # Exclude dependency folders like .venv
  ├─ my_app.py # Entrypoint file
  └─ pyproject.toml
```
</CodeGroup>

```bash
# Successful deployment CLI output
SUCCESS  Compressed files
SUCCESS  Deployment successful
SUCCESS  App "my_app.ts" deployed with action(s): [my-action]
INFO  Invoke with: kernel invoke my-app my-action --payload '{...}'
SUCCESS  Total deployment time: 2.78s
```

Once deployed, you can [invoke](/apps/invoke) your app from anywhere.
