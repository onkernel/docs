Kernel's app deployment process is as simple as it is fast. There are no configuration files to manage or complex CI/CD pipelines.

Once you deploy an app on Kernel, you can schedule its actions on a job or run them from other contexts. You can even run actions multiple times in parallel.


## Deploy the app

### From local directory

Use our CLI from the root directory of your project:
```bash
kernel deploy <entrypoint_file_name>
```

#### Notes

- The `entrypoint_file_name` is the file name where you [defined](/apps/develop) your app.
- Include a `.gitignore` file to exclude dependency folders like `node_modules` and `.venv`.

### From GitHub

You can deploy an app directly from a public or private GitHub repository using the Kernel CLI — no need to clone or manually push code.

```bash
kernel deploy github \
  --url https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> \
  --ref <branch|tag|commit> \
  --entrypoint <path/to/entrypoint> \
  [--path <optional/subdir>] \
  [--github-token <token>] \
  [--env KEY=value ...] \
  [--env-file .env] \
  [--version latest] \
  [--force]
```

#### Notes
- **`--path` vs `--entrypoint`:** Use `--path` to specify a subdirectory within the repo (useful for monorepos), and `--entrypoint` for the path to your app's entry file relative to that directory (or repo root if no `--path` is specified).
- The CLI automatically downloads and extracts the GitHub source code and uploads your app for deployment.
- For private repositories, provide a `--github-token` or set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Environment variables

You can set environment variables for your app using the `--env` flag. For example:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Typescript/Javascript
kernel deploy my_app.ts --env MY_ENV_VAR=my_value # Can add multiple env vars delimited by space
```

```bash Python
kernel deploy my_app.py --env MY_ENV_VAR=my_value # Can add multiple env vars delimited by space
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deployment notes

- **The dependency manifest (`package.json` for JS/TS, `pyproject.toml` for Python) must be present in the root directory of your project.**
- View deployment logs using: `kernel deploy logs <deployment_id> --follow`
- Kernel assumes the root directory contains at least this file structure:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Typescript/Javascript
project-root/
  ├─ .gitignore # Exclude dependency folders like node_modules
  ├─ my_app.ts # Entrypoint file (can be located in a subdirectory, e.g. src/my_app.ts)
  ├─ package.json
  ├─ tsconfig.json # If using TypeScript
  └─ bun.lock | package-lock.json | pnpm-lock.yaml # One of these lockfiles
```

```bash Python
project-root/
  ├─ .gitignore # Exclude dependency folders like .venv
  ├─ my_app.py # Entrypoint file
  └─ pyproject.toml
```
</CodeGroup>

```bash
# Successful deployment CLI output
SUCCESS  Compressed files
SUCCESS  Deployment successful
SUCCESS  App "my_app.ts" deployed with action(s): [my-action]
INFO  Invoke with: kernel invoke my-app my-action --payload '{...}'
SUCCESS  Total deployment time: 2.78s
```

Once deployed, you can [invoke](/apps/invoke) your app from anywhere.
