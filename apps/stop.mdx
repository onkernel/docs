title: "Stopping"
---

You can terminate an invocation that's running. This is useful for stopping automations or agents stuck in an infinite loop.

<Info>
Terminating an invocation also destroys any browsers associated with it.

## Via API
You can stop an invocation by setting its status to `failed`. This will cancel the invocation and mark it as terminated.

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const client = new Kernel({
  apiKey: 'My API Key',
});

const invocation = await client.invocations.update('invocation_id', {
  status: 'failed',
  output: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invocation cancelled by user' })
});
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

client = Kernel(
    api_key="My API Key",
)

invocation = client.invocations.update(
    id="invocation_id",
    status='failed',
    output='{"error":"Invocation cancelled by user"}'
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Via CLI
Use `ctrl-c` in the terminal tab where you launched the invocation.
