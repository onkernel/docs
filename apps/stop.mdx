title: "Stopping"
---

You can terminate an invocation that's running. This is useful for stopping automations or agents stuck in an infinite loop.

<Info>
Terminating an invocation also destroys any browsers associated with it.

## Via API
You can stop an invocation by setting its status to `failed`. This will cancel the invocation and mark it as terminated.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const invocation = await kernel.invocations.update('invocation_id', {
  status: 'failed',
  output: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Invocation cancelled by user' }),
});
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()
invocation = kernel.invocations.update(
    id="invocation_id",
    status="failed",
    output='{"error":"Invocation cancelled by user"}',
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Via CLI
Use `ctrl-c` in the terminal tab where you launched the invocation.
