title: "Stopping"
---

You can terminate an invocation that's running. You can use this to stop automations or agents stuck in an infinite loop.

<Info>
Terminating an invocation also destroys any browsers associated with it.
</Info>

## Via API
You can also do this by making a `DELETE` request to Kernel's API:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';

await Kernel.invocations.delete(invocationId);
```

```python Python
import kernel

kernel.invocations.delete(invocation_id)
```
</CodeGroup>


## Via CLI
Use `ctrl-c` in the terminal tab where you launched the invocation.
