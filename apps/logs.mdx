## Via API

After you [invoke](/apps/invoke) an action, you can stream the invocation's logs in real time:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const logs = await kernel.invocations.follow(invocation_id);
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()
logs = kernel.invocations.follow(invocation_id)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Via CLI

You can also stream the logs to your terminal via the CLI:

```bash
kernel logs <app_name> --follow
```

If you don't specify `--follow`, the logs will print to the terminal until 3 seconds of inactivity and then stops.

You can get logs for a specific invocation by adding:
```
-i --invocation <invocation id>    Show logs for a specific invocation of the app.
```
