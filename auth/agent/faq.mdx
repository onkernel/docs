## How re-authentication works

When you save credentials, Kernel keeps your session authenticated automatically. Kernel runs periodic checks to detect expired sessions, and when logout is detected, re-auth happens automatically. When you create a browser with the profile, it's already logged in.

### Initial login

Initial login uses AI to discover the login page and identify form fields. This happens once per site—credentials are never passed to the LLM.

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|
| Discover login page | AI |
| Identify form fields | AI |
| Fill and submit credentials | Deterministic |
| Handle captcha | Stealth mode + captcha solver |
| Verify login success | AI |

### Re-authentication

Re-authentication is fully deterministic. No AI, no guessing—just replaying the stored login flow.

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|
| Navigate to login page | Deterministic (stored URL) |
| Fill and submit credentials | Deterministic (stored field mapping) |
| Handle captcha | Stealth mode + captcha solver |
| Verify login success | AI |

### Session monitoring

Session monitoring runs periodic auth checks (default: every hour) to detect expired sessions. When logout is detected, re-auth happens automatically.

<Info>
For sites with short session timeouts, configurable check intervals per auth agent are coming soon.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does Kernel check if a session is expired before creating a browser?">
    Yes. Kernel runs periodic auth checks (default: every hour) to detect expired sessions. When you create a browser with a profile, the session is already authenticated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Kernel know which login page URL to use?">
    During initial login, AI discovers the login page for the domain. This URL is stored and reused deterministically for all future re-authentications.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does Kernel know which fields to put credentials into?">
    During initial login, AI identifies the form fields (username, password, etc.). The field mapping is stored and reused deterministically for re-authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is re-authentication deterministic or probabilistic?">
    Re-authentication is fully deterministic. After the initial AI-powered discovery, all subsequent logins replay the exact same flow—same URL, same field mapping, same steps. No AI, no guessing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When does AI get used vs deterministic replay?">
    AI is used only during **initial login** to discover the login page and identify form fields. All **re-authentications** are deterministic replays of the stored flow. The only exception is verifying login success, which uses AI to confirm the session is authenticated.
