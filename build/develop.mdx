Kernel is a flexible cloud platform that enables you to deploy and execute code without managing infrastructure. With Kernel, you can take your code from local development to production in seconds â€” the same time it takes to run it locally.

## Apps, Actions, and Invocations

An `App` is the codebase deployed on Kernel. You can use Kernel for a variety of use cases, including web automation, data processing, AI agents, and more.

An `Action` is an invokable method within an app. Actions allow your to register entry points or functions that can be triggered on-demand. Actions can call non-action methods. Apps can have multiple actions.

An `Invocation` is a single execution of an action. Invocations can be triggered via API, scheduled as a job, or run on-demand.

<Tip>
  Install our [sample apps](/quickstart#1-download-the-sample-app) to get up and running with Playwright, Browser Use, Computer Use, or Stagehand!

## Getting started: create an app

First, install the Kernel SDK and create an app.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();
const app = kernel.app('my-app-name');
```

```Python Python
import kernel

client = Kernel()
app = kernel.App("my-app-name")
```
</CodeGroup>

Then, define and register an action that you want to invoke:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
// Define a method called `myActionMethod` and register it as an action
app.action("my-action-name", myActionMethod);
```

```python Python
# Define a method called `myActionMethod` and register it as an action
@app.action("my-action-name")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Parameters

Action methods receive two parameters:

- `runtimeContext`: Contextual information provided by Kernel during execution
- `payload`: Optional runtime data that you provide when invoking the action. [Read more](/launch/invoke#payload-parameter)

This consistent interface ensures your code runs identically in both local and production environments, enabling seamless integration across development and deployment.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const myActionMethod = async (runtimeContext, payload) => {
  const { tshirt_size, color, shipping_address } = payload;
  // ...
};
```

```python Python
def my_action_method(runtime_context, payload):
    tshirt_size, color, shipping_address = (
        payload["tshirt_size"],
        payload["color"],
        payload["shipping_address"]
    )
    # ...
```
</CodeGroup>

## Environment variables

Set environment variables when [deploying](/launch/deploy#environment-variables) your app. They then can be accessed in the usual way:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const ENV_VAR = process.env.ENV_VAR;
const myActionMethod = async (runtimeContext, payload) => {
  // ...
};
```

```python Python
import os

ENV_VAR = os.getenv("ENV_VAR")
def my_action_method(runtime_context, payload):
    # ...
```
</CodeGroup>

## Return values

Action methods can return values, which will be returned in its [invocation's](/launch/invoke#return-values) final response.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const myActionMethod = async (runtimeContext, payload) => {
  const { tshirt_size, color, shipping_address } = payload;
  // ...
  return {
    order_id: "example-order-id",
  }
};
```

```python Python
def my_action_method(runtime_context, payload):
    tshirt_size, color, shipping_address = (
        payload["tshirt_size"],
        payload["color"],
        payload["shipping_address"]
    )
    # ...
    return {"order_id": "example-order-id"}
```
</CodeGroup>


## Example Use Cases

Kernel's flexible, fast platform enables a wide range of applications:

- **Web Automation**: Create browser-based workflows using Playwright or Puppeteer
- **API Integration**: Build middleware services connecting different systems
- **AI Agents**: Deploy and orchestrate autonomous agents
- **Data Processing**: Run data processing jobs

For specific implementation details about writing browser automations, read our [Browser Frameworks](/build/browser-frameworks) guide.

Once you're happy with your app, follow [these steps](/launch/deploy) to deploy and invoke it on the Kernel platform.  The entire process takes just seconds, maintaining the same rapid feedback loop that you're used to in your local development environment.
