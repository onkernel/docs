Kernel provides first-class support for **browser automation frameworks**, supporting CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) connections like Playwright and Puppeteer out of the box.

When using Kernel's [app platform](/build/develop), we **co-locate** your code with the browser environment in the cloud. This solves common issues with remote browsers:

- **Reduced latency**: Your code runs directly alongside the browser, reducing round-trip latency
- **Improved reliability**: No unexpected disconnects between your code and browser
- **Higher throughput**: Eliminates bandwidth bottlenecks during data-intensive operations like screenshots
- **Simplified debugging**: Access to browser logs and execution context in the same environment

## Creating a browser automation app

To create a browser automation app with Kernel, simply define an app and action that creates a Kernel browser.

### 1. Create an app and define a browser action

Start by creating your app and defining an action for your browser automation:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();
const app = kernel.app('browser-automation');

const playwrightScript = async (runtimeContext, payload) => {
// ...
};

app.action("my-action-name", playwrightScript);

````

```Python Python
import kernel

client = Kernel()
app = kernel.App("browser-automation")

@app.action("my-action-name");
def playwright_script(runtime_context, payload):
	# ...
	pass
````

</CodeGroup>

### 2. Connect to a browser in your action

Within your action, use Kernel's `browsers.create()` method to generate a CDP websocket URL for your browser automation framework.

`browsers.create()` requires the runtime's `invocation_id` when you deploy and launch your app on Kernel. This is provided to you in the `runtimeContext` object generated during the invocation's lifecycle:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const playwrightScript = async (runtimeContext, payload) => {
	const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({ invocation_id: runtimeContext.invocation_id });
	const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernelBrowser.cdp_ws_url);
	// ...
};
```

```python Python
def playwright_script(runtime_context, payload):
	kernel_browser = kernel.browsers.create(invocation_id=runtime_context.invocation_id)
	browser = playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url)
	#...
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Complete example

<Info>
  Kernel browsers launch with a default context and page. Make sure to access
  the [existing context and
  page](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-connect-over-cdp)
  (`contexts()[0]` and `pages()[0]`), rather than trying to create a new one.
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

const kernel = new Kernel();
const app = kernel.app('browser-automation');

const playwrightScript = async (runtimeContext, payload) => {
const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({ invocation_id: runtimeContext.invocation_id });
const browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(kernelBrowser.cdp_ws_url);

    try {
    	const context = await browser.contexts()[0] || (await browser.newContext());

const page = await context.pages()[0] || (await context.newPage());
await page.goto("https://www.google.com");
const title = await page.title();
} catch (error) {
console.error(error);
} finally {
await browser.close();
}
};

app.action("my-action-name", playwrightScript);

````

```python Python
import kernel
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

client = Kernel()
app = kernel.App("browser-automation")

@app.action("my-action-name")
def playwright_script(runtime_context, payload):
    async with async_playwright() as playwright:
    	kernel_browser = await kernel.browsers.create(invocation_id=runtime_context.invocation_id)
    	browser = await playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp(kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url)

    	try:
			context = browser.contexts[0] if browser.contexts else await browser.new_context()
        	page = context.pages[0] if context.pages else await context.new_page()
        	await page.goto(url)
          	title = await page.title()
		except Exception as e:
			print(e)
      	finally:
			await browser.close()
````

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  Make sure to call `browser.close()` at the end of your action to ensure the
  browser connection is properly closed.

## Web agent frameworks: environment variables

Web agent frameworks sometimes require environment variables (e.g. LLM API keys). Set them when [deploying](/launch/deploy#environment-variables) your app.
