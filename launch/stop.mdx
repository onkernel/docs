We recommend building in safeguards to prevent deployed agents from endless loops. If needed, you can terminate an invocation that's running in the CLI using `cmd-c`.

You can also do this by making a `DELETE` request to Kernel's API:
<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const response = await fetch(`https://api.onkernel.com/invocations/${invocationId}/browsers`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});
```

```python Python
response = requests.delete(
    f"https://api.onkernel.com/invocations/{invocation_id}/browsers",
    headers={
        'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.environ.get('KERNEL_API_KEY')}",
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

Or via the SDK:
<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';

await Kernel.invocations.delete(invocationId);
```

```python Python
import kernel

kernel.invocations.delete(invocation_id)
```
</CodeGroup>


<Info>
Terminating an invocation also destroys any browsers associated with it.
