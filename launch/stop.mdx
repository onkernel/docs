title: "Stopping"
---

You can terminate an invocation that's running. You can use this to stop automations or agents stuck in an infinite loop.

<Info>
Terminating an invocation also destroys any browsers associated with it.
</Info>

### Stopping an invocation via CLI
Use `ctrl-c` in the terminal tab where you launched the invocation.

### Stopping an invocation via API
You can also do this by making a `DELETE` request to Kernel's API:
<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const response = await fetch(`https://api.onkernel.com/invocations/${invocationId}/browsers`, {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
});
```

```python Python
response = requests.delete(
    f"https://api.onkernel.com/invocations/{invocation_id}/browsers",
    headers={
        'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.environ.get('KERNEL_API_KEY')}",
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Stopping an invocation via SDK
<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';

await Kernel.invocations.delete(invocationId);
```

```python Python
import kernel

kernel.invocations.delete(invocation_id)
```
</CodeGroup>
