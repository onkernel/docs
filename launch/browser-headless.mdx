title: "Headless"
---

Kernel browsers ship in `headful` mode by default. In headful mode, the launched browser has a corresponding GUI. This enables features like [live view](/observability/live-view) and [replays](/observability/replays).

`Headless` mode runs without a visual interface. They generally run faster and have a lighter footprint (requires 1 GB rather than headful's 8 GB), resulting in significant cost savings. This is useful for short-lived or highly concurrent browser automations.

To launch a Kernel browser in `headless` mode, set its config:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
    headless: true
});
```

```python Python
kernel_browser = client.browsers.create(headless=True)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    Live View and Replays are not available in headless mode.
