title: "Standby Mode"
---

Kernel browsers go into standby mode if there aren't any network requests for a given amount of time. When a browser goes into standby mode, the browser's state remains the same but incurs zero usage costs. The browser is reactivated the moment it receives an incoming network request.

Standby mode can happen in multiple scenarios:
1. The corresponding invocation is `RUNNING` but there is no network activity
2. Browsers [marked](/launch/browser-persistence) for persistence go into standby after an invocation completes

<Info>
    Browsers not marked for persistence are destroyed after an invocation completes.

This means you don't pay for the browser's idle clock time. This is especially useful when you'd like to persist browser state for a particular user or use case over a long period of time (even indefinitely).

The current time-to-idle is `4 seconds`.
