title: "Stealth Mode"
---

Kernel browsers can be configured to `stealth` mode, which adds a high performant residential proxy and auto-CAPTCHA solver to your instances.

To turn on stealth mode, set its flag in your app code when instantiating Kernel:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
    invocation_id: ctx.invocation_id,
    stealth: true,
});
```

```python Python
kernel_browser = client.browsers.create(invocation_id=ctx.invocation_id, stealth=True)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    [Anthropic Computer Use](/quickstart#sample-apps-reference) stops when it runs into a CAPTCHA. Use Kernel's auto-captcha solver by adding this prompt to the end of your `query` payload when running `kernel invoke`:
    
    `"If you see a CAPTCHA or similar test, just wait for it to get solved automatically by the browser."`
