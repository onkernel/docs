Kernel proxies enable you to route browser traffic through different types of proxy servers, providing enhanced privacy, flexibility, and bot detection avoidance. Proxies can be created once and reused across multiple browser sessions.

## Proxy Types

Kernel supports five types of proxies, ranked by quality (from best to worst):

0. [**Custom**](/proxies/custom) - Your own proxy servers
1. [**Mobile**](/proxies/mobile) - Traffic routed through mobile carrier networks
2. [**Residential**](/proxies/residential) - Traffic routed through residential ISP connections
3. [**ISP**](/proxies/isp) - Traffic routed through ISP data centers
4. [**Datacenter**](/proxies/datacenter) - Traffic routed through commercial data centers

## 1. Create a proxy

Create a proxy configuration from the types above that can be reused across browser sessions:

<CreateProxySnippet />

## 2. List your proxies

View all proxy configurations in your organization:

<ListProxiesSnippet />

## 3. Use with browsers

Once created, you can attach a proxy to any browser session using the `proxy_id` parameter:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
const kernel = new Kernel();

// Create or use existing proxy
const proxy = await kernel.proxies.create({
  type: 'residential',
  name: 'US Residential',
  config: {
    country: 'US'
  }
});

// Create browser with proxy
const browser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  proxy_id: proxy.id
});
```

```Python Python
import kernel
client = kernel.Kernel()

# Create or use existing proxy
proxy = client.proxies.create(
    type='residential',
    name='US Residential',
    config={
        'country': 'US'
    }
)

# Create browser with proxy
browser = client.browsers.create(
    proxy_id=proxy.id
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## 4. Delete a proxy

When no longer needed, delete the proxy configuration:

<DeleteProxySnippet />

<Info>
Deleting a proxy does not affect existing browser sessions that are currently using it. The configuration is only removed from your organization so it can't be used in future browser sessions.
