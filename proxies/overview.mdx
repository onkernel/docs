Kernel proxies enable you to route browser traffic through different types of proxy servers, providing enhanced privacy, flexibility, and bot detection avoidance. Proxies can be created once and reused across multiple browser sessions.

## Proxy Types

Kernel supports four types of proxies:

1. [**Datacenter**](/proxies/datacenter) - Traffic routed through commercial data centers
2. [**ISP**](/proxies/isp) - Traffic routed through data centers, using residential IP addresses leased from from internet service providers
3. [**Residential**](/proxies/residential) - Traffic routed through real residential IP addresses
4. [**Custom**](/proxies/custom) - Your own proxy servers

Datacenter has the fastest speed, while residential is least detectable. ISP is a balance between the two options, with less-flexible geotargeting. Kernel recommends to use the first option in the list that works for your use case.

## 1. Create a proxy

Create a proxy configuration from the types above that can be reused across browser sessions:

<CreateProxySnippet />

## 2. List your proxies

View all proxy configurations in your organization:

<ListProxiesSnippet />

## 3. Use with browsers

Once created, you can attach a proxy to any browser session using the `proxy_id` parameter:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
const kernel = new Kernel();

// Create or use existing proxy
const proxy = await kernel.proxies.create({
  type: 'residential',
  name: 'my-us-residential',
  config: {
    country: 'US'
  }
});

// Create browser with proxy
const browser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  proxy_id: proxy.id
});
```

```Python Python
import kernel
client = kernel.Kernel()

# Create or use existing proxy
proxy = client.proxies.create(
    type='residential',
    name='my-us-residential',
    config={
        'country': 'US'
    }
)

# Create browser with proxy
browser = client.browsers.create(
    proxy_id=proxy.id
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## 4. Delete a proxy

When no longer needed, delete the proxy configuration:

<DeleteProxySnippet />

<Info>
Deleting a proxy immediately reconfigures associated browsers to route directly to the internet.

## Limitations

Some sites are blocked by the proxy network:
- Government websites
- Google
- LinkedIn
