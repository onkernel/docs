title: "ISP Proxies"
---

ISP proxies use residential IP addresses hosted on high-speed servers, purchased or leased from Internet Service Providers for commercial use. Target sites classify them as residential IPs, allowing you to access websites like a real user while maintaining the speed and reliability of datacenter infrastructure. They're ideal when datacenter proxies are blocked but you still need fast, cost-effective proxies.

## Configuration

Create an ISP proxy with optional targeting:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
const kernel = new Kernel();

const proxy = await kernel.proxies.create({
  type: 'isp',
  name: 'My ISP Proxy'
});

const browser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  proxy_id: proxy.id
});
```

```Python Python
import kernel
client = kernel.Kernel()

proxy = client.proxies.create(
    type='isp',
    name='My ISP Proxy'
)

browser = client.browsers.create(
    proxy_id=proxy.id
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration Parameters

- **`country`** (required) - ISO 3166 country code. Not many countries are supported for ISP proxies, try to create a proxy in a country to check if it's available.
