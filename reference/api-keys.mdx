## Authentication Methods

Kernel supports two authentication methods:

### OAuth 2.0 (Recommended for CLI)

The preferred authentication method to use the CLI is OAuth 2.0, which provides secure browser-based authentication with automatic token refresh:

```bash
kernel login
```

This method stores your credentials securely in your system keychain and handles token refresh automatically.

### API Keys

API keys are an alternative authentication method, particularly useful for programmatic access, CI/CD pipelines, or when OAuth is not suitable:

```bash
export KERNEL_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Creating API Keys

To create an API key:

1. Sign up for a Kernel account [here](https://dashboard.onkernel.com/sign-up)
2. Navigate to your dashboard settings
3. Generate a new API key
4. Store it securely and use it in your environment
