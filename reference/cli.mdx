title: "Kernel CLI"
---

The Kernel CLI helps you deploy and run web automation apps on our platform.

## Installation

Install the Kernel CLI using your favorite package manager:

```bash
# Using brew
brew install onkernel/tap/kernel

# Using pnpm
pnpm install -g onkernel/cli

# Using npm
npm install -g onkernel/cli
```

## Authentication

The Kernel CLI supports two authentication methods:

### OAuth 2.0 (Recommended)

The preferred method is OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, which provides secure browser-based authentication:

```bash
# Login via browser
kernel login
```

This opens your browser to complete the OAuth flow. Your tokens are securely stored in your system keychain (macOS/Windows) or a local file (Linux).

### API Key

You can also authenticate using an API key:

```bash
export KERNEL_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```

## Verifying installation
After installation, verify that Kernel CLI was installed correctly:

```bash
which kernel
```

## Authentication Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kernel login [--force]` | Initiates OAuth 2.0 authentication flow via browser. Use `--force` to re-authenticate when already logged in |
| `kernel logout` | Clears stored authentication tokens and logs out |
| `kernel auth` | Displays current authentication status, user details, and token expiry. Use `--log-level debug` for detailed information including user ID and storage method |

## App Management Commands

| Command | Optional Flags | Description |
|---------|-------------| -------------|
| `kernel deploy <entrypoint_file_name>` | - | Deploys an app to Kernel from the current directory. |
| | `--env <ENV_VAR=VAL>` | Adds environment variables to the app. Expects the form `ENV_VAR=VAL` delimited by spaces. Optional. |
| `kernel invoke <app_name> <action_name>` | - | Invokes a specific app action by its name. Generates an Invocation. |
| | `--payload <payload_data>` | Includes the specified parameters. Expects a stringified JSON object. Optional. |
| | `ctrl-c` | Terminates the running invocation in your CLI. Also destroys any associated browsers. |
| `kernel logs <app_name>` | - | Prints the logs for the specified app. |
| | `--follow` | Follows the logs. Optional. |
| | `--log-level <log_level>` | Specify the log level to print: trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, print. Optional. |
| | `--no-color` | Disables color output|

## Browser Management Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kernel browser delete <persistent_browser_id>` | Deletes the specified persistent browser |

## General Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kernel help [command]` | Displays help information about Kernel commands |

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: Run `kernel login` to authenticate via OAuth 2.0
   - Opens your browser to complete the authentication
   - Displays your organization after successful login
   - If already logged in, shows current status (use `--force` to re-authenticate)

2. **Check Status**: Use `kernel auth` to view your authentication details
   - Shows authentication method (OAuth vs API Key)
   - Displays user email and organization
   - Shows token expiry status and remaining time
   - Use `--log-level debug` for additional details like storage method

3. **Secure Storage**: Tokens are stored securely
   - macOS/Windows: OS Keychain
   - Linux: Local file (~/.config/kernel/credentials)
   - Automatic token refresh when needed

4. **Logout**: Use `kernel logout` to clear stored credentials
   - Shows which organization you're logging out from
   - Removes all stored authentication tokens

The CLI supports both OAuth and API key authentication, with OAuth being the recommended approach for interactive use.
