## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use real applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one. We've shipped foundational tech, landed paying customers, and are well-funded while still in stealth.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and the messy details of web interaction so developers can focus on what their agents do, not how they do it. **Kernel makes AI tangible, practical, and powerful** ‚Äî allowing developers to deploy agents that can truly interact with the digital world.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.** One line of code deploys any web agent to our cloud. The rest is up to you.

## About the role

As **Founding Infrastructure Engineer** at Kernel, you'll architect and build the core systems that power our AI agent platform end-to-end. You'll own critical infrastructure from conception to production, working with bleeding edge tech that needs to be both reliable and low latency. You'll also play a foundational role in how we build Kernel's culture.

- **Excited to crush it:** we're moving fast and looking for people excited about high velocity, high impact work‚Äîand having fun along the way.
