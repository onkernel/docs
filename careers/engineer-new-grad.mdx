## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and enabling human-in-the-loop interactions in production.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.**

## About the role

As **New Grad Software Engineer** at Kernel, you'll build the core systems that power our AI agent platform end-to-end. You'll own critical developer-focused APIs + frontend surfaces from conception to production, working with bleeding edge tech that needs to be both reliable and low latency. You'll also play a foundational role in how we build Kernel's culture.

## What you'll do

- Design, develop, and scale new our product suite of **developer tools, CLIs, APIs, frontend interfaces**
- Ship quickly and iterate on our product based on user feedback
- Shape Kernel's hiring decisions and **culture** as we grow

## What we're looking for

- Must be a **current or recent graduate** (&lt; 2 years of work experience) in computer science
- Must be **Cincinnati-based** and **in-person** alongside our CTO
- **Low ego, high impact:** you care more about building something meaningful than who gets credit
- **Start-up ready:** early stage sometimes means figuring it out as we go, and that energizes rather than drains you
- **Excited to crush it:** we're moving fast and looking for people excited about high velocity, high impact work, and having fun along the way.

## What you can expect as a Kernel

- **Industry-competitive salary**
- Premium **medical + dental coverage** + dependent coverage
- Small, trusting team of **senior + staff engineers**
- Directly work and receive **mentorship** in-person with our CTO
- **$1k / mo budget** for LLM usage fees #vibecheck
- **Daily lunches** on us
- **Unlimited PTO**
- 401k + company match
- Relocation assistance

## Hiring process

We have a simple process focused on real world collaboration and jointly getting to know each other:

1. 30 minute **intro calls** with each of Kernel's co-founders (1 hour total)
2. Half-day on-site (virtual or in-person) working with our team and co-founders on relevant technical challenges.
3. **Offer!**
