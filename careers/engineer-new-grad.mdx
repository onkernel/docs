## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use real applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one. We've shipped foundational tech, landed paying customers, and are well-funded while still in stealth.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and the messy details of web interaction so developers can focus on what their agents do, not how they do it. **Kernel makes AI tangible, practical, and powerful** ‚Äî allowing developers to deploy agents that can truly interact with the digital world.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.** One line of code deploys any web agent to our cloud. The rest is up to you.

## About the role

As **New Grad Software Engineer** at Kernel, you'll build the core systems that power our AI agent platform end-to-end. You'll own critical developer-focused APIs + frontend surfaces from conception to production, working with bleeding edge tech that needs to be both reliable and low latency. You'll also play a foundational role in how we build Kernel's culture.

## What you'll do

- Design, develop, and scale new our product suite of **developer tools, CLIs, APIs, frontend interfaces**
- Ship quickly and iterate on our product based on user feedback
- Shape Kernel's hiring decisions and **culture** as we grow

## What we're looking for

- Must be a **current or recent graduate** (&lt; 2 years of work experience) in computer science
- Must be **Cincinnati-based**‚Äîthis role is **in-person** alongside our CTO
- **Low ego, high impact:** you care more about building something meaningful than who gets credit
- **Start-up ready:** early stage sometimes means figuring it out as we go, and that energizes rather than drains you
- **Excited to crush it:** we're moving fast and looking for people excited about high velocity, high impact work‚Äîand having fun along the way.

## What you can expect as a Kernel

- **Industry-competitive salary**
- Premium **medical + dental coverage** + dependent coverage
