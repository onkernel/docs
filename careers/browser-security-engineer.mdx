## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one.

Our platform handles the hard stuff: spinning up browsers quickly and efficiently at scale, providing great observability into their activity, and enabling both humans and AI agents to interact with them. 

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.**

## About the role

We're hiring a **Browser Security Engineer** to harden and extend our Chromium-based browser runtime. You'll work at the intersection of sandboxing, networking, and virtualization ‚Äî ensuring our browsers run securely and efficiently across thousands of concurrent users.

## What you'll do

Debug, patch, and optimize Chromium builds running inside Kernel's microVM environments.

- Implement and maintain **network isolation**, proxy routing, and IP handling for browsers.
- Collaborate with infra engineers on **unikernel-based isolation**, process scheduling, and kernel security policies.
- Build internal tooling for **binary analysis**, crash triage, and vulnerability monitoring.
- Support the team in maintaining **secure supply chain** and reproducible builds for our browser images.

## What we're looking for

- Deep familiarity with **Chromium internals**, browser sandboxes, or renderer/network stacks.
- Experience with Linux kernel, **microVMs** (Firecracker, Cloud-Hypervisor, Kata, gVisor, etc.), or container isolation.
- Strong debugging skills with strace, gdb, perf, or similar low-level tools.
- Knowledge of **networking fundamentals** (DNS, TCP/IP, NAT, proxies, TLS).
- Background in **security engineering** or browser hardening a plus.

## What you can expect as a Kernel

- **Industry-competitive salary**
- **Above market equity**
- Premium **medical + dental coverage** + dependent coverage
- Small, trusting team of **senior + staff engineers**
- Default async with **minimal bureaucracy**, only one meeting a week
- **$1k / mo budget** for LLM usage fees #vibecheck
- **Daily lunches** on us
- **Unlimited PTO**
- 401k + company match
- Relocation assistance

## Hiring process

We have a simple process focused on real world collaboration and jointly getting to know each other:

1. 30 minute **intro calls** with each of Kernel's co-founders (1 hour total)
2. Half-day on-site (virtual or in-person) working with our team and co-founders on relevant technical challenges.
3. **Offer!**
