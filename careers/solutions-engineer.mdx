## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use real applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one. We've shipped foundational tech, landed paying customers, and are well-funded while still in stealth.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and the messy details of web interaction so developers can focus on what their agents do, not how they do it. **Kernel makes AI tangible, practical, and powerful**, allowing developers to deploy agents that can truly interact with the digital world.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.** One line of code deploys any web agent to our cloud. The rest is up to you.

## About the role

As a **Founding Solutions Engineer** at Kernel, you'll sit at the intersection of engineering, product, and customer impact — helping some of the most innovative AI teams in the world build with Kernel's programmable browsers. You'll debug, prototype, and shape how the next generation of browser-powered agents gets built.

This is a **hands-on engineering role**: you'll spend **~50% of your time coding** open source tools, customer integrations, and the rest helping developers succeed. You'll be the [Alex Albert](https://x.com/alexalbert__) of Kernel, pushing the AI industry forward by showing what is possible.

## What you'll do

- Partner directly with **AI and infra teams at customers** to architect solutions and debug complex browser automation flows
- Build **example apps, SDKs, and quickstarts** that make Kernel's API feel magical
- Translate **customer feedback into product improvements and roadmap priorities**
- Jump into real code **(Playwright, Puppeteer, Browser Use, etc.)** to help customers build with Kernel

## What we're looking for
- You're fluent in **JavaScript/TypeScript** or **Python** and comfortable working close to the browser and API layer
- You can explain complex systems clearly — **whether in code, writing, or conversation**
- You've worked in **infra, devtools, or AI agent ecosystems** and get what “good developer experience” feels like
- You're user-obsessed — you love to help users succeed through support, great documentation, and hands-on engineering
- **Bonus:** experience supporting enterprise pilots, API integrations, or on-prem setups

## What you can expect as a Kernel

- **Industry-competitive salary**
- **Above market equity**
- Premium **medical + dental coverage** + dependent coverage
- Small, trusting team of **senior + staff engineers**
- Default async with **minimal bureaucracy**, only two meetings a week
- **$1k / mo budget** for LLM usage fees #vibecheck
- **Daily lunches** on us
- **Unlimited PTO**
- 401k + company match
- Relocation assistance

## Hiring process

We have a simple process focused on real world collaboration and jointly getting to know each other:

1. 30 minute **intro calls** with each of Kernel's co-founders (1 hour total)
2. Half-day on-site (virtual or in-person) working with our team and co-founders on relevant challenges.
3. **Offer!**
