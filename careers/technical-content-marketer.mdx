## About Kernel

Kernel is building the developer platform that lets AI agents use browsers. Our edge is cloud infrastructure: extensible, observable, built to scale from day one.

We run the hard stuff‚Äîautoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, session persistence, observability, human-in-the-loop workflows‚Äîso developers don't have to. Every LLM that has tool access also needs a browser ‚Äî that's Kernel.

## About the role

We're looking for someone who lives at the **intersection of developer tools, browser automation, and AI agents**. Someone who can go deep on technical infra (unikernels, WebRTC, microVMs) and then translate that into content that excites, educates, and grows a community.

You might be a developer who's already a prolific blogger, a dev advocate with a content bias, or a content marketer who vibe codes on weekends. The common thread: you know how developers think and you love writing.

## What you'll do

- Write **deep technical content**: blog posts, tutorials, guides, docs on topics like persistence, stealth mode, unikernel startup, and live-view debugging.
- Tell **Kernel's story**: use cases, customer stories, why we exist, what problems we solve, and how we're different.
- **Run our blog + newsletter**: grow a consistent voice for Kernel across blog, newsletter, and social, highlighting features, demos, and open-source projects.
- Shape **social content**: repurpose long-form content into short, scroll-stopping posts. Keep Kernel present in the developer/agent ecosystem.
- **Spot trends**: stay ahead of conversations around agentic AI, infra, and automation, and plug Kernel into those discussions.


## What we're looking for
- **You love writing** and are comfortable with code (you've coded, or at least read/write it with ease).
- **You understand developer workflows** and can pick up browser automation frameworks (Playwright, Puppeteer, Browser Use, Computer Use).
- You can switch between long-form content (tutorials, whitepapers) and snappy social posts.
- **You love high velocity environments**: Kernel ships fast, and you do too! You can draft, edit, and publish multiple pieces a week across formats (blogs, docs, social), balancing speed with technical depth.
- You're plugged into developer + startup culture, following what's trending.
- **Experience with SEO** + growth of social presence.

## What you can expect as a Kernel

- **Industry-competitive salary**
- **Above market equity**‚Äî 0.1% to 0.25% (first content hire).
- Premium **medical + dental coverage** + dependent coverage
- Small, trusting team of builders
- Default async‚Äî**minimal bureaucracy**, only two meetings a week
- **$1k / mo budget** for LLM usage fees #vibecheck
- **Daily lunches** on us
- **Unlimited PTO**
- 401k + company match
- Relocation assistance

## Hiring process

We have a simple process focused on real world collaboration and jointly getting to know each other:

1. 30 minute **intro calls** with each of Kernel's co-founders (1 hour total)
2. Half-day on-site (virtual or in-person) working with our team and co-founders on relevant technical challenges.
3. **Offer!**
