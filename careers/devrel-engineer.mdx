## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use real applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one. We've shipped foundational tech, landed paying customers, and are well-funded while still in stealth.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and the messy details of web interaction so developers can focus on what their agents do, not how they do it. **Kernel makes AI tangible, practical, and powerful**, allowing developers to deploy agents that can truly interact with the digital world.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.** One line of code deploys any web agent to our cloud. The rest is up to you.

## About the role

As a **DevRel Engineer** at Kernel, you'll be part builder, part solutions engineer, and fully embedded in the developer community.

This is a **hands-on engineering role**: you'll spend **~50% of your time coding** open source tools, demos, and SDKs and the rest helping developers succeed. You'll be the [Alex Albert](https://x.com/alexalbert__) of Kernel, pushing the AI industry forward by showing what is possible.

## What you'll do

- Build **OSS tools, libraries, demos, and integrations** that make Kernel's devEx more powerful and easier to use
- Support **enterprise customers** with hands-on solutions engineering
- Engage with our **community** on GitHub, Slack, and Twitter, answering questions and amplifying cool projects
- Contribute to Kernel's **technical blog**, developing content that educates, inspires, and grows developer adoption
- Influence Kernel's **culture, product, and direction** as a founding team member

## What we're looking for

- **You ship**: tools, projects, and ideas that push the ecosystem forward
- **You code (and vibe code)**: strong engineering background who cares about great devEx (our inspirations: Modal, Supabase, PlanetScale)
- **You get developers**: you know what excites them, what annoys them, and how to speak their language
- **You want impact**: you're energized by small, high impact teams and want to build something that delights software engineers

## What you can expect as a Kernel

- **Industry-competitive salary**
- **Above market equity**
- Premium **medical + dental coverage** + dependent coverage
- Small, trusting team of **senior + staff engineers**
- Default async with **minimal bureaucracy**, only two meetings a week
- **$1k / mo budget** for LLM usage fees #vibecheck
- **Daily lunches** on us
- **Unlimited PTO**
- 401k + company match
- Relocation assistance

## Hiring process

We have a simple process focused on real world collaboration and jointly getting to know each other:

1. 30 minute **intro calls** with each of Kernel's co-founders (1 hour total)
2. Half-day on-site (virtual or in-person) working with our team and co-founders on relevant challenges.
3. **Offer!**
