## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and enabling human-in-the-loop interactions in production.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.**
