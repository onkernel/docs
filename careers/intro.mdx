## About Kernel

We're building *the* developer platform that lets AI agents use real applications, starting with browsers. Our edge is an infrastructure platform that's extensible, observable, and built for scale from day one. We've shipped foundational tech, landed paying customers, and are well-funded while still in stealth.

Our **serverless platform** handles the hard stuff: autoscaling reliable browser infrastructure, observability, and the messy details of web interaction so developers can focus on what their agents do, not how they do it. **Kernel makes AI tangible, practical, and powerful** â€” allowing developers to deploy agents that can truly interact with the digital world.

**If you're interested in building critical infrastructure for the next generation of AI applications, we'd love to chat.** One line of code deploys any web agent to our cloud. The rest is up to you.
