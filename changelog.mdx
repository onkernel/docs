<Update label="January 23" tags={["Product"]}>
## Product updates
- [Browser pools](/browsers/pools) are now generally available for our Startup and Enterprise plans! Make your startup times even faster with a fleet of instant browsers that come pre-loaded with the logins, cookies, and extensions your agents depend on.

- We improved the Browsers page user experience. Enjoy instant clickability of browser cards, shift+click range selection, preserved view state when switching between grid and list views, a live toggle for auto-refresh, keyboard shortcut support (Cmd+B / Ctrl+B to toggle sidebar), and more.
- We added support for viewing [replays](/browsers/replays) of deleted browser sessions. Deleted browsers now navigate to their detail page, which shows the replay player with multiple replays displayed as tabs. The API now supports fetching deleted browser details using new query parameters.
- We improved the [live view](/browsers/live-view) experience to show a clear "disconnected" screen when a browser is destroyed, instead of leaving users on a blank page.
</Update>

<Update label="January 16" tags={["Product", "Docs"]}>
## Product updates
- Added a Past Sessions view to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.onkernel.com/) showing your 100 most recent browser sessions; provided context about the session history limit.
- Improved browser session stability to reduce premature disconnections and WebSocket failures.

## Documentation updates
- Updated Playwright examples on the [File I/O page](https://www.kernel.sh/docs/browsers/file-io) with a more streamlined approach for uploads and downloads.

</Update>

<Update label="January 9" tags={["Product", "Docs"]}>
## Product updates
- Introduced a new [Hobbyist plan](https://www.kernel.sh/#pricing), which provides affordable access to features like session replays, uploading and downloading files, and using custom Chrome extensions.
- Updated the Gemini [Computer Use template](/integrations/computer-use/gemini) to [use](https://github.com/kernel/cli) Stagehand V3, resolving compatibility issues.
- Added support for Actor and Thinker [OpenAGI models](https://github.com/kernel/kernel-oagi), with guidance on when to use each approach.
- Added new [Claude Agent SDK templates](/integrations/claude-agent-sdk) for TypeScript and Python that demonstrate browser automation using Kernel's Playwright execution API.

## Documentation updates
- Added documentation for the OpenAGI Lux [integration](/integrations/computer-use/openagi) using the `kernel create` method, including examples for both `AsyncDefaultAgent` and `TaskerAgent`.
- Improved [file I/O documentation](/browsers/file-io) with code examples for uploading and downloading files from remote browsers.
</Update>

<Update label="December 19" tags={["Product"]}>
## Product updates
- Added a new `kernel mcp install` [command](/reference/cli/mcp) to the [Kernel CLI](https://github.com/onkernel/cli) that automatically configures the Kernel MCP server for AI development tools like Cursor, Claude, and Visual Studio Code.
- Added a new Python template to the [Kernel CLI](https://github.com/onkernel/cli) for OpenAGI's Lux computer use model, supporting both AsyncDefaultAgent and TaskerAgent with Kernel browser session management.
- Improved CLI performance when looking up browsers by using a direct API call instead of fetching the full list of browsers.
- Fixed bug where headless browsers started with no pages. Headless browsers now initialize with an initial page.
- Fixed bug where replay start and end times were not being returned by the API.
</Update>

<Update label="December 12" tags={["Product", "Docs"]}>
## Product updates
- Refreshed our [Vercel template](https://kernel-nextjs-template.vercel.app/) with an enhanced UI and AI agent example
- Deprecated the "persistent" feature from browsers in favor of using extended `timeout_seconds` with [Profiles](/browsers/profiles#3-use-the-browser,-then-close-it-to-persist-the-state); added `name` field to browsers for easier identification
- Unified browser creation tools by porting [Create Kernel App](/reference/cli/create) functionality into the Kernel CLI
- Improved replay videos to include full video length metadata, enabling timestamp navigation and deep linking

## Documentation updates
- Added OpenAGI [integration guide](/integrations/computer-use/openagi) to the Computer Use integrations section
</Update>

<Update label="December 5" tags={["Product", "Docs"]}>
## Product updates

- Updated the maximum async invocation [duration](/apps/invoke#asynchronous-invocations) from 15 minutes to 1 hour
- Improved error messaging when invalid invocation IDs are provided

## Documentation updates
- [Stagehand v3](/integrations/stagehand): Added code example for using Stagehand v3 with Kernel browsers
- [Vercel AI SDK integration](/integrations/vercel/ai-sdk): Expanded Vercel integration documentation for the `@onkernel/ai-sdk` package
- [Live view](/browsers/live-view#embedding-in-an-iframe): Added code example showing how to embed browser live views in an iFrame
