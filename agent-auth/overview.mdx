Agent Auth is an AI-powered platform that allows you to securely login to websites on behalf of end users and use their authentication (profile) in future automations. It intelligently discovers login forms, dynamically generate credential inputs, and handle multi-step authentication flows like 2FA/OTP.

## Why Agent Auth?

AI agents can navigate the open web with ease, but the most valuable workflows live behind logins. To perform tasks on behalf of real users, agents need a secure way to access authenticated sessions.

Agent Auth solves this by providing:

- **Unified access to logged-in websites** - One API to log agents into any site with user consent
- **Automatic form discovery** - Detects login form fields on any website
- **Multi-step auth handling** - Handles 2FA, OTP, magic links, and CAPTCHAs
- **Credential security** - Credentials are encrypted and submitted programmatically—never stored in plaintext or shared with LLMs
- **Session persistence** - Saves authenticated browser profiles for reuse
- **Automatic session monitoring** - Regular checks detect when re-authentication is needed

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Auth Agent">
    Call `kernel.agents.auth.create()` to initialize an Auth Agent for a specific domain and [profile](/browsers/profiles) combination.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start an Authentication Flow">
    Call `kernel.agents.auth.invocations.create()` to start the auth flow. This returns a `hosted_url` where the end user can complete their login. You can also build your own user experience a using our headless API.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Completes Login">
    The end user is redirected to the hosted UI where they enter credentials and handle 2FA if needed. The profile is saved on success.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use the Authenticated Profile">
    Create browsers with the saved profile using `kernel.browsers.create({ profile: { name: 'my-profile' } })`. Browsers start already logged in.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integration Options

Agent Auth offers two integration approaches:

### Hosted UI (Recommended)

The simplest approach—redirect users to our hosted authentication UI. Best for:
- User-facing applications
- When you want Kernel to handle the login UI
- Quick integration with minimal code

See [Hosted UI Guide](/agent-auth/hosted-ui) for implementation details.

### Programmatic API

Build your own authentication UI using the lower-level discover and submit APIs. Best for:
- Custom UI requirements
- Automated/headless scenarios
- When you have credentials stored

See [Programmatic Guide](/agent-auth/programmatic) for implementation details.

## Security

Agent Auth is designed with security as a first principle:

| Security Feature | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Credentials never stored in plaintext** | All credential values are encrypted at rest using per-organization encryption keys |
| **Credentials never shared with LLMs** | Credentials are submitted programmatically to target sites, never passed through AI models |
| **Short-lived tokens** | JWT tokens for programmatic flows expire after 30 minutes |
| **One-time handoff codes** | Handoff codes can only be exchanged once and expire after 5 minutes |
| **Profile encryption** | Browser profiles are encrypted end-to-end |
| **Isolated execution** | Each auth flow runs in an isolated browser environment |
