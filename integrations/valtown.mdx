[Val Town](https://www.val.town/) is a serverless platform to run Typescript automations. You can think of it like Zapier for software developers.

Because Val Town can't launch a local browser, Kernel lets you use tools like Puppeteer or Playwright on Val Town by connecting to a remote browser session hosted on Kernel's infrastructure.

## Quick start with Puppeteer
1. Create a free [Kernel account](https://onkernel.com/) and generate an API key from Settings â†’ API Keys
2. Remix this [Kernel starter val](https://www.val.town/x/onkernel/kernel_starter)
3. Add it to your Val Town val's Environment Variables (left sidebar) as `KERNEL_API_KEY`
4. Click **Run** on `puppeteer.ts`
5. View logs for output

## Quick start with Playwright

Kernel also supports Playwright sessions.

The steps are nearly identical:

1. Remix this [Kernel starter val](https://www.val.town/x/onkernel/kernel_starter)
2. Add your `KERNEL_API_KEY` to Environment Variables
3. Set `TMPDIR` to `/tmp` to avoid Playwright file-system warnings
4. Click **Run** on `playwright.ts`
5. Check the logs for output
