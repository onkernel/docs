Connect 1Password to automatically use credentials from your existing vaults with [Agent Auth](/auth/agent/overview). No need to manually create credentials in Kernel—1Password items are discovered by domain matching.

## How It Works

1. **Connect a service account** — Add your 1Password service account token in the dashboard
2. **Domain matching** — When Agent Auth needs credentials, it searches your connected vaults for items matching the target domain
3. **Automatic fill** — Credentials (including TOTP secrets) are used to complete authentication

<Note>
Credentials are retrieved securely at authentication time. Values are never stored in Kernel—they remain in 1Password.
</Note>

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a 1Password Service Account">
    In 1Password, create a [service account](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/) with access to the vaults containing your login credentials.

    Copy the service account token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect in Kernel Dashboard">
    Go to **Agent Auth** in the Kernel dashboard, click the **settings icon**, then select **Integrations**. Click **Connect 1Password**.

    Paste your service account token. Kernel will validate the connection and show which vaults are accessible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use with Agent Auth">
    Start an auth invocation without specifying a `credential_id`. If 1Password has a matching item for the domain, it will be used automatically.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
const agent = await kernel.agents.auth.create({
  domain: 'github.com',
  profile_name: 'my-github-profile',
  // No credential_name needed—1Password will provide credentials
});

const invocation = await kernel.agents.auth.invocations.create({
  auth_agent_id: agent.id,
});
// Credentials for github.com are automatically retrieved from 1Password
```

```python Python
agent = await kernel.agents.auth.create(
    domain="github.com",
    profile_name="my-github-profile",
    # No credential_name needed—1Password will provide credentials
)

invocation = await kernel.agents.auth.invocations.create(
    auth_agent_id=agent.id,
)
# Credentials for github.com are automatically retrieved from 1Password
```
</CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Domain Matching

1Password items are matched by their website/URL field:

| 1Password Item URL | Matches Domain |
|-------------------|----------------|
| `github.com` | `github.com` |
| `https://github.com/login` | `github.com` |
| `*.example.com` | `app.example.com`, `api.example.com` |

If multiple items match a domain, the first match is used. Organize your vaults to ensure the correct credentials are selected.

## TOTP Support

If your 1Password item has a one-time password (TOTP) field configured, it will be used automatically for 2FA—no additional setup needed.

## Priority

When both Kernel credentials and 1Password are available for a domain:

1. **Explicit credential** — If `credential_name` or `credential_id` is specified, that credential is used
2. **1Password** — If no explicit credential, 1Password is searched
3. **Request input** — If no credentials found, the auth agent waits for input

## Security

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Token encrypted** | Service account token encrypted with per-org keys |
| **No credential storage** | Credentials stay in 1Password, retrieved at auth time |
| **Vault access control** | Limit access via 1Password service account permissions |
| **Audit trail** | 1Password logs all credential access |
