## Vercel + Kernel

Kernel partners with Vercel to provide seamless browser automation capabilities for your Vercel applications. Our integration offers two powerful ways to add browser automation to your projects:

### Vercel Marketplace Integration

The [Vercel Marketplace integration](/integrations/vercel/marketplace) allows you to install and configure Kernel directly from the Vercel dashboard. This integration:

- Automatically provisions a Kernel Organization and API key
- Syncs your `KERNEL_API_KEY` to your Vercel project's environment variables
- Manages billing directly through Vercel
- Syncs team members and roles between Vercel and Kernel

### AI SDK Tool for Browser Automation

The `@onkernel/ai-sdk` package provides a Vercel AI SDK-compatible tool that enables AI agents to execute Playwright code on Kernel remote browsers. This tool integrates seamlessly with:

- **Vercel AI SDK's `generateText()`** - For direct LLM-powered browser automation
- **Vercel AI SDK's `Agent()` class** - For building autonomous browser automation agents

With this tool, you can build AI-powered applications that browse the web, extract data, interact with websites, and perform complex automation tasks—all through natural language instructions.

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Kernel integration** from the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/kernel)
2. **Connect Kernel to your Vercel project** to sync your API key
3. **Install the AI SDK tool** in your application:
   ```bash
   npm install @onkernel/ai-sdk ai @onkernel/sdk
   ```
4. **Start building** browser automation agents

## Use Cases

- **Web Scraping & Data Extraction** - Extract data from websites using natural language
- **Automated Testing** - Build AI-powered test automation
- **Web Monitoring** - Monitor websites for changes or specific content
- **Form Automation** - Automate form submissions and data entry
- **Content Generation** - Generate screenshots, PDFs, or capture web content

## Example

Here's a quick example using the AI SDK tool with Vercel's `generateText()`:

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { playwrightExecuteTool } from '@onkernel/ai-sdk';
import { Kernel } from '@onkernel/sdk';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const kernel = new Kernel({ apiKey: process.env.KERNEL_API_KEY });
const browser = await kernel.browsers.create();

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5.1'),
  prompt: 'Open example.com and summarize the main content',
  tools: {
    playwright_execute: playwrightExecuteTool({
      client: kernel,
      sessionId: browser.session_id,
    }),
  },
});

console.log(result.text);
```
