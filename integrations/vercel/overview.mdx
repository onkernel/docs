## Vercel + Kernel

Kernel and Vercel have partnered to provide seamless browser automation capabilities for your Vercel applications. Our integration offers two powerful ways to add browser automation to your projects:

### Vercel Marketplace Integration

The [Vercel Marketplace integration](/integrations/vercel/marketplace) allows you to install and configure Kernel directly from the Vercel dashboard. This integration:

- Automatically provisions a Kernel Organization and API key
- Syncs your `KERNEL_API_KEY` to your Vercel project's environment variables
- Manages billing directly through Vercel
- Syncs team members and roles between Vercel and Kernel

### AI SDK Tool for Browser Automation

The `@onkernel/ai-sdk` package provides a Vercel AI SDK-compatible tool that enables AI agents to execute Playwright code on Kernel remote browsers. This tool integrates seamlessly with:

- **Vercel AI SDK's `generateText()`** - For direct LLM-powered browser automation
- **Vercel AI SDK's `Agent()` class** - For building autonomous browser automation agents

With this tool, you can build AI-powered applications that browse the web, extract data, interact with websites, and perform complex automation tasks—all through natural language instructions.
