[Notte](https://www.notte.cc/) is an AI agent framework that enables you to build sophisticated browser automation tasks. By integrating with Kernel, you can run Notte agents with cloud-hosted browsers using Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).

## Adding Kernel to existing Notte implementations

If you already have a Notte implementation, you can easily switch to using Kernel's cloud browsers by connecting via CDP.

### 1. Install the required SDKs

```bash
pip install notte-sdk kernel
```

### 2. Initialize Kernel and create a headless browser

Import the libraries and create a headless cloud browser session:

```python
from kernel import Kernel
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

# Initialize Kernel client
client = Kernel(api_key="your-api-key")

# Create a headless Kernel browser session
kernel_browser = client.browsers.create(headless=True)
```

### 3. Connect Notte to Kernel's CDP endpoint

Use Kernel's CDP WebSocket URL to create a Notte session:

```python
# Initialize Notte client
notte = NotteClient()

# Connect to Kernel browser via CDP
with notte.Session(cdp_url=kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url) as session:
    # Create and run your agent
    agent = notte.Agent(session=session, max_steps=5)
    agent.run(task="extract pricing plans from https://www.notte.cc/")
```

### 4. Clean up the browser session

After your automation completes, tear down the Kernel browser:

```python
# Clean up
client.browsers.delete_by_id(kernel_browser.session_id)
```

## Complete example script

Here's a complete, runnable script that demonstrates the full integration:

```python
from kernel import Kernel
from notte_sdk import NotteClient

def main():
    # Initialize clients
    client = Kernel(api_key="your-api-key")
    notte = NotteClient()

    # Create a headless browser on Kernel
    kernel_browser = client.browsers.create(headless=True)

    try:
        # Connect Notte to Kernel's browser via CDP
        with notte.Session(cdp_url=kernel_browser.cdp_ws_url) as session:
            # Create an agent with a task
            agent = notte.Agent(session=session, max_steps=10)

            # Run your automation task
            result = agent.run(
                task="Go to https://example.com and extract the main heading"
            )

            print(f"Task completed: {result}")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during automation: {e}")

    finally:
        # Always clean up the browser session
        client.browsers.delete_by_id(kernel_browser.session_id)
        print("Browser session cleaned up")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Benefits of using Kernel with Notte

- **No local browser management**: Run agents without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Headless execution**: Perfect for server environments and CI/CD pipelines
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent tasks
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Leverage Kernel's optimized browser infrastructure
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for web scraping
- **Session control**: Programmatic control over browser lifecycle
