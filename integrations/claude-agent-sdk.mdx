The [Claude for Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/claude/hbhbdkfkmpfgjfegglflhflgjpojgnll) brings Claude's powerful AI capabilities directly into your browser. With Kernel's Claude Agent SDK integration, you can run the Claude extension in cloud-hosted browsers, enabling automated interactions with Claude without managing local browser infrastructure.

By integrating the Claude Agent SDK with Kernel, you can programmatically send messages to Claude, receive responses, and build AI-powered automations that leverage Claude's capabilities in the browser.

## Quick setup with Claude Agent SDK

Get started with the Claude Agent SDK using the Kernel CLI:

### Step 1: Extract the extension from your local Chrome

First, extract the Claude extension and authentication data from your local Chrome installation:

```bash
# Extract extension + auth data to a bundle file
kernel claude extract -o claude-bundle.zip

# Extract without auth (will require login in browser)
kernel claude extract -o claude-bundle.zip --no-auth

# Use a specific Chrome profile
kernel claude extract -o claude-bundle.zip --chrome-profile "Profile 1"
```

### Step 2: Launch a Kernel browser with Claude pre-loaded

Launch a cloud browser with the Claude extension automatically loaded and authenticated:

```bash
# Launch browser with Claude extension
kernel claude launch -b claude-bundle.zip

# Launch with custom timeout
kernel claude launch -b claude-bundle.zip -t 7200

# Launch and navigate to a specific URL
kernel claude launch -b claude-bundle.zip --url https://example.com
```

### Step 3: Interact with Claude

Once your browser is running, you can interact with Claude programmatically:

```bash
# Check extension status
kernel claude status <browser-id>

# Send a single message (scriptable)
kernel claude send <browser-id> "What is 2+2?"

# Send from stdin
echo "Explain this error" | kernel claude send <browser-id>

# Send from file
kernel claude send <browser-id> -f prompt.txt

# Interactive chat TUI
kernel claude chat <browser-id>
```

### Loading into an existing browser

You can also load the Claude extension into an existing Kernel browser session:

```bash
# Load Claude into an existing browser session
kernel claude load <browser-id> -b claude-bundle.zip
```

## Available commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `kernel claude extract` | Extract the Claude extension and authentication data from a local Chrome installation |
| `kernel claude launch` | Launch a new Kernel browser with the extension pre-loaded and authenticated |
| `kernel claude load` | Load the extension into an existing Kernel browser |
| `kernel claude status` | Check the extension's state in a browser |
| `kernel claude send` | Send single messages programmatically (scriptable) |
| `kernel claude chat` | Interactive chat with Claude via a TUI |

## Benefits of using Kernel with Claude Agent SDK

- **No local browser management**: Run Claude automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Authenticated sessions**: Extract and reuse your Claude authentication across cloud browsers
- **Scriptable interactions**: Send messages and receive responses programmatically for automation workflows
- **Interactive chat**: Use the built-in TUI for interactive conversations with Claude
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent AI agents
- **Live view**: Debug your Claude agents with real-time browser viewing
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Run AI-powered automations without local resource constraints
