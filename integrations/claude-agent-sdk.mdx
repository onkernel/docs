title: "Claude Agent SDK"
---

The [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) provides a powerful way to build AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks. By integrating the Claude Agent SDK with Kernel, you can create agents that browse the web and interact with websites using cloud-hosted browser infrastructure.

This integration combines Claude's agent capabilities with Kernel's Playwright Execution API to enable browser automation without managing local browser infrastructure.

## Quick setup with Claude Agent SDK

Get started with Claude Agent SDK and Kernel using our pre-configured app template:

```bash
kernel create --name my-claude-agent-app --template claude-agent-sdk
```

Choose `TypeScript` or `Python` as the programming language.

Then follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/) to deploy and run your Claude Agent SDK automation on Kernel's infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

### Claude Code Installation

The Claude Agent SDK requires Claude Code to be installed. Follow the [official installation guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview#get-started):

```bash
# macOS/Linux/WSL
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

<Note>
When deploying to Kernel, the app automatically installs Claude Code on the remote infrastructure.
</Note>

### API Keys

You'll need:
- **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY**: Get from the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **KERNEL_API_KEY**: Get from the [Kernel Dashboard](https://dashboard.onkernel.com/api-keys)

## Running locally

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run with default task
pnpm exec tsx index.ts

# Run with custom task
pnpm exec tsx index.ts "Go to duckduckgo.com and search for 'Kernel browser automation'"
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run with default task
uv run main.py

# Run with custom task
uv run main.py "Go to duckduckgo.com and search for 'Kernel browser automation'"
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Deploying to Kernel

Deploy and invoke the app on Kernel's infrastructure:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="TypeScript">
```bash
# Login to Kernel
kernel login

# Deploy the app with environment variables
kernel deploy index.ts --env-file .env

# Invoke the action (logs stream automatically)
kernel invoke ts-claude-agent-sdk agent-task -p '{"task": "Go to https://news.ycombinator.com and get the top 3 stories"}'
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Python">
```bash
# Login to Kernel
kernel login

# Deploy the app with environment variables
kernel deploy main.py --env-file .env

# Invoke the action (logs stream automatically)
kernel invoke py-claude-agent-sdk agent-task -p '{"task": "Go to https://news.ycombinator.com and get the top 3 stories"}'
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How it works

1. **Browser Creation**: A Kernel browser session is created with stealth mode enabled
2. **MCP Server**: An in-process MCP server is created with an `execute_playwright` tool
3. **Agent Execution**: The Claude Agent SDK runs with access to the Playwright tool
4. **Task Completion**: Claude autonomously uses the tool to complete the given task
5. **Cleanup**: The browser session is deleted when done

## Example tasks

```bash
# Get top Hacker News stories
"Go to https://news.ycombinator.com and tell me the top 3 stories"

# Search for something
"Go to duckduckgo.com and search for 'Kernel browser automation'"

# Extract data from a page
"Go to https://github.com/trending and list the top 5 trending repositories"
```

## Benefits of using Kernel with Claude Agent SDK

- **No local browser management**: Run Claude Agent SDK automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent AI agents
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for reliable web interactions
- **Session state**: Maintain browser state across runs via [Profiles](/browsers/profiles)
- **Live view**: Debug your Claude agents with real-time browser viewing
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Run computationally intensive AI agents without local resource constraints
