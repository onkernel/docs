Kernel's browsers are compatible with all browser and Computer Use frameworks.

## Universal compatibility

Kernel browsers work with any framework or tool that supports the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). This means you can:

- **Use any agent framework**: Integrate with popular frameworks like Browser Use, Stagehand, Playwright, Puppeteer, Selenium, and more
- **Connect via CDP**: All browsers expose a CDP WebSocket URL for direct connection
- **No vendor lock-in**: Switch between frameworks or use multiple frameworks simultaneously
- **Standard protocols**: Built on open standards that work with the entire browser automation ecosystem
