[Gemini 2.5 Computer Use](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/multimodal-agents) is Google's powerful capability that enables AI models to interact with computers through screen observation, cursor control, and keyboard input. This feature allows AI agents to autonomously navigate websites, interact with web applications, and perform complex multi-step tasks.

By integrating Gemini 2.5 Computer Use with Kernel (via Stagehand), you can run these AI-powered browser automations on cloud-hosted infrastructure, eliminating the need for local browser management and enabling scalable, reliable AI agents.

## Quick setup with our example template

Get started quickly with our TypeScript template that demonstrates Gemini 2.5 Computer Use with Kernel:

Check out the [ts-stagehand-google-cua-agent](https://github.com/onkernel/ts-stagehand-google-cua-agent) repository for a complete working example that shows how to:
- Set up Gemini 2.5 Computer Use with Kernel
- Use Stagehand for browser automation
- Run AI-powered web interactions on cloud infrastructure

## Benefits of using Kernel with Gemini Computer Use

- **No local browser management**: Run Computer Use automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent automations
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for web interactions
- **Session persistence**: Maintain browser state across automation runs
- **Live view**: Debug your automations with real-time browser viewing
