Google's [Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/) is a specialized model built on Gemini 2.5 Pro's capabilities to power agents that can interact with user interfaces.

By integrating Gemini 2.5 Computer Use with Kernel, you can run these AI-powered browser automations on cloud-hosted infrastructure, eliminating the need for local browser management and enabling scalable, reliable AI agents.

## Quick setup with our example template

Get started quickly with our TypeScript template that demonstrates Gemini 2.5 Computer Use with Kernel.

Check out the [Open-source Gemini Template](https://github.com/onkernel/ts-stagehand-google-cua-agent) repository for a complete working example that shows how to:
- Set up Gemini 2.5 Computer Use with Kernel
- Use Stagehand for browser automation
- Run AI-powered web interactions on cloud infrastructure

## Benefits of using Kernel with Gemini Computer Use

- **No local browser management**: Run Computer Use automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent automations
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for web interactions
- **Session persistence**: Maintain browser state across automation runs
- **Live view**: Debug your automations with real-time browser viewing
