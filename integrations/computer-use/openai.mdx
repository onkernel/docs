[Computer Use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-computer-use) is OpenAI's feature that enables AI models to interact with computers like humans do - through screen observation, cursor movement, and keyboard input. By integrating with Kernel, you can run Computer Use automations with cloud-hosted browsers, allowing your AI agents to navigate websites, fill forms, and interact with web applications autonomously.

## Quick setup with our Computer Use example app

Get started quickly with our Kernel app template that includes a pre-configured Computer Use integration:

```bash
npx @onkernel/create-kernel-app my-computer-use-app
```

Choose `TypeScript` or `Python` as the programming language and then select `CUA Sample` as the template.

Then follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/) to deploy and run your Computer Use automation on Kernel's infrastructure.

## Benefits of using Kernel with Computer Use

- **No local browser management**: Run Computer Use automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent automations
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for web interactions
- **Session persistence**: Maintain browser state across automation runs
- **Live view**: Debug your automations with real-time browser viewing
