[Computer Use](https://openai.com/index/computer-using-agent/) is OpenAI's feature that enables AI models to interact with computers the way humans doâ€”by looking at screens, moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. This powerful feature allows AI agents to control web browsers, navigate interfaces, and perform complex tasks across applications.

By integrating Computer Use with Kernel, you can run these AI-powered browser automations on cloud-hosted infrastructure, eliminating the need for local browser management and enabling scalable, reliable AI agents.

## Quick setup with our Computer Use example app

Get started quickly with our Kernel app template that includes a pre-configured Computer Use integration:

```bash
npx @onkernel/create-kernel-app my-computer-use-app
```

Choose `TypeScript` or `Python` as the programming language and then select `CUA Sample` as the template.

Then follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/) to deploy and run your Computer Use automation on Kernel's infrastructure.

## Benefits of using Kernel with Computer Use

- **No local browser management**: Run Computer Use automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent automations
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for web interactions
- **Session persistence**: Maintain browser state across automation runs
- **Live view**: Debug your automations with real-time browser viewing
