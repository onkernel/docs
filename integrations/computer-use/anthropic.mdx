[Computer Use](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool) is Anthropic's groundbreaking capability that enables Claude to interact with computers the way humans doâ€”by looking at screens, moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. This powerful feature allows AI agents to control web browsers, navigate interfaces, and perform complex tasks across applications.

By integrating Computer Use with Kernel, you can run these AI-powered browser automations on cloud-hosted infrastructure, eliminating the need for local browser management and enabling scalable, reliable AI agents.

## Quick setup with Computer Use

Get started with Computer Use and Kernel using our pre-configured app template:

```bash
npx @onkernel/create-kernel-app my-computer-use-app
```

Choose `TypeScript` or `Python` as the programming language and then select `Computer Use` as the template.

Then follow the [Quickstart guide](/quickstart/) to deploy and run your Computer Use automation on Kernel's infrastructure.

## Benefits of using Kernel with Computer Use

- **No local browser management**: Run Computer Use automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent AI agents
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for reliable web interactions
- **Session persistence**: Maintain browser state across automation runs
- **Live view**: Debug your Computer Use agents with real-time browser viewing
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Run computationally intensive AI agents without local resource constraints
