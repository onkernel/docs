title: "OpenAGI"
---

The [OpenAGI](https://lux.agiopen.org/) Lux Model is a computer-use model that enables AI agents to interact with computers the way humans do. Lux operates in a continuous action-observation loop: it receives a task, analyzes a screenshot of the current screen state, generates the next UI interaction (click, type, etc.), and repeats until the goal is achieved.

By integrating OpenAGI with Kernel, you can run these AI-powered browser automations on cloud-hosted infrastructure, eliminating the need for local browser management and enabling scalable, reliable computer-using agents.

## Getting started

To get started with OpenAGI Lux and Kernel:

1. Get your `OAGI_API_KEY` on the [OpenAGI Developer Platform](https://developer.agiopen.org/) 
2. Get your `KERNEL_API_KEY` from the [Kernel Dashboard](https://dashboard.onkernel.com)

For more information about Lux's capabilities, visit the [OpenAGI Lux Documentation](https://lux.agiopen.org/).

## Quick setup with Computer Use

Get started with OpenAGI and Kernel by cloning our pre-configured integration repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onkernel/kernel-oagi.git
```

You can also browse the open-source repo directly at [github.com/onkernel/kernel-oagi](https://github.com/onkernel/kernel-oagi).

<Info>Follow the [App Platform docs](/apps/develop) to turn this into a Kernel App, deploy it, and run your Computer Use automation on Kernel's infrastructure.</Info>

## Benefits of using Kernel with OpenAGI

- **No local browser management**: Run OpenAGI automations without installing or maintaining browsers locally
- **Scalability**: Launch multiple browser sessions in parallel for concurrent AI agents
- **Stealth mode**: Built-in anti-detection features for reliable web interactions
- **Session state**: Maintain browser state across runs via [Profiles](/browsers/profiles)
- **Live view**: Debug your OpenAGI agents with real-time browser viewing
- **Cloud infrastructure**: Run computationally intensive AI agents without local resource constraints
