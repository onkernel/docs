# Vercel Integration

Our official Vercel integration is coming soon! In the meantime, you can get started with Kernel on Vercel using our pre-configured template below.

## Quick Start

Clone the template and get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onkernel/vercel-template.git
cd vercel-template
```

## Setup

1. **Sign up for Kernel** at [dashboard.onkernel.com](https://dashboard.onkernel.com)

2. **Add your API keys** to the `.env` file in both `packages/agent` and `packages/web` directories:

   ```bash
   KERNEL_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

3. **Deploy the agent to Kernel**:

   ```bash
   pnpm run deploy:agent
   ```

4. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev:web
   ```

The web app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The template is organized as a monorepo with two main packages:

```
kernel-vercel-template/
├── packages/
│   ├── agent/     # Kernel agent (deployed as an action)
│   └── web/       # Web app (Next.js frontend)
```

### Agent Package

The agent is deployed as an [action](/info/concepts#action) in your Kernel app. It uses our [Claude Computer Use Playwright SDK](https://github.com/onkernel/cu-playwright-ts) to control the browser.

**Monitor your agent:**

```bash
cd packages/agent
pnpm run logs
```

### Web Package

The web app provides the chat interface using:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the framework
- [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) for AI integration
- [Assistant-UI](https://github.com/assistant-ui/assistant-ui) for the chat interface

The chatbot is deployed as a [route](packages/web/app/api/chat/route.ts) and uses the `browserAgentTool` to control the browser. You can extend this to build custom chatbots with your own tools.

## Features

- **Web Agent Chatbot** - Ready-to-use AI agent that can browse the web
- **Browser Automation** - Powered by Kernel's sandboxed Chrome browsers
- **Live View Streaming** - Visual monitoring and remote control capabilities
- **Chrome DevTools Integration** - Compatible with Playwright and Puppeteer
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type safety throughout the application

## What You Can Build

With this template, you can:

- Run automated browser-based workflows
- Develop and test AI agents that use browsers
- Build custom tools that require controlled browser environments
- Create web scraping and automation solutions

## Coming Soon

Our official Vercel integration will include:

- **One-click deployment** from the Kernel dashboard
- **Built-in monitoring** and observability
- **Advanced configuration options**
- **Template marketplace** with pre-built solutions
