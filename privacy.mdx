Thank you for your interest in Kernel Technologies, Inc., ("Kernel," "we", "our" or "us"). Kernel provides browser infrastructure for developers building agents and automation. This Privacy Notice explains how information about you, that directly identifies you, or that makes you identifiable ("personal information") is collected, used and disclosed by Kernel in connection with our website at onkernel.com (the "Site") and our services offered in connection with the Site (collectively with the Site, the "Service").

Cookies and Tracking: We use cookies and similar technologies for authentication, session persistence, product analytics (e.g., feature usage, latency), and improvement. See Section 12 (Cookie Policy) for more detail.

Browser Automation Data: When you run automated sessions via Kernel, we may collect metadata and logs related to the activity performed, such as the DOM structure accessed, screenshots, timing data, input/output events, and error traces.

Customer-Controlled End-User Data: If you use Kernel to automate workflows involving end-user data (e.g., filling forms), you are the data controller of that information. Kernel only processes this data as instructed via your automations and does not persist it beyond session scope unless you explicitly request storage or logging.
