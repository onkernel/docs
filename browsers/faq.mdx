## Browser spin-up time

Non-standard configuration can affect browser spin-up time. Settings like non-default [viewport sizing](/browsers/viewport), [extensions](/browsers/extensions), or [Profiles](/browsers/profiles) may increase the time it takes for a browser to become ready.

**Standard configuration** includes:
- Headful and headless browsers
- Stealth mode both enabled and disabled

If you're experiencing slower-than-expected browser creation times, review your configuration to identify any non-standard settings that may be contributing to the delay.

## Connection notes

- **CDP connections** are meant to be long-lived but may eventually close. Websocket connections typically can remain active for up to 1 hour, after which they may close automatically. Browser sessions themselves are unaffected—reconnect to the same `cdp_ws_url` to continue using the browser.
- Browsers persist independently of CDP. Depending on your browser [persistence](/browsers/persistence) or [timeout](/browsers/termination#timeouts-for-non-persisted-browsers) configuration, it will continue running even if the CDP connection closes. You can reconnect to the same `cdp_ws_url` if you're unexpectedly disconnected.
- We recommend implementing reconnect logic, as network interruptions or lifecycle events can cause CDP sessions to close. Detect disconnects and automatically re-establish a CDP connection when this occurs.

## Unsupported Websites

There are some websites that are not supported by Kernel browsers due to their restrictions around automation and associated bot detection. These include:

- LinkedIn
- Facebook
- Instagram
- X (Twitter)
- Amazon
- Reddit
