title: "Stealth Mode"
---

Kernel browsers can be configured to `stealth` mode, which automatically adds our recommended proxy to your browser instances. It also adds a `reCAPTCHA solver` to the browser, so it automatically solves [reCAPTCHAs](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo) on your behalf.

To turn on stealth mode, set its flag when instantiating Kernel browsers:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  stealth: true,
});
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()

kernel_browser = kernel.browsers.create(
    stealth=True,
)
```
</CodeGroup>

If you're looking for proxy-level configuration with Kernel browsers, see [Proxies](/proxies/overview).

## CAPTCHA Handling Behavior

Below are tips for working with Kernel's Stealth Mode auto-CAPTCHA solver across different challenge types and automation frameworks.

### Anthropic Computer Use

Anthropic Computer Use stops when it encounters a CAPTCHA. Use Kernel's auto-CAPTCHA solver by adding this to your prompt:

`"If you see a CAPTCHA or similar test, just wait for it to get solved automatically by the browser."`

### Cloudflare Challenge

When encountering a Cloudflare challenge, our auto-CAPTCHA solver will attempt to handle it. Once the "Ready" message appears on the screen, continue with your intended browser actions (e.g., entering credentials and submitting a login attempt). 

<Info>
After the "Ready" message appears, don't click the Cloudflare CAPTCHA checkbox — this can interfere with the solver.
