title: "Stealth Mode"
---

Kernel browsers can be configured to `stealth` mode, which adds our recommended proxy configuration to your browser instances. It also adds a `reCAPTCHA solver` to the browser, so it automatically solves [reCAPTCHAs](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo) on your behalf.

To turn on stealth mode, set its flag when instantiating Kernel browsers:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  stealth: true,
});
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()

kernel_browser = kernel.browsers.create(
    stealth=True,
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    [Anthropic Computer Use](/quickstart#sample-apps-reference) stops when it runs into a CAPTCHA. Use Kernel's auto-captcha solver by adding this to your prompt:
    
    `"If you see a CAPTCHA or similar test, just wait for it to get solved automatically by the browser."`
</Info>

If you're looking for proxy-level configuration with Kernel browsers, see [Proxies](/proxies/overview).
