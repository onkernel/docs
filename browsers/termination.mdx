title: "Termination & Timeouts"
---

Kernel browsers should be terminated after you're done with them.

## Via API

You can delete a browser by making a `DELETE` request to Kernel's API:

import DeleteBrowser from '/snippets/openapi/delete-browsers-id.mdx';

<DeleteBrowser />

## Timeouts for non-persisted browsers

If you don't manually delete a `non-persisted` browser, deletion will happen automatically after a configurable `timeout` (default 60 seconds). If the browser does not see a CDP or live view connection within that timeout, then it is automatically deleted.

You can set a custom timeout of up to 24 hours via the API:

import CreateBrowserTimeout from '/snippets/openapi/post-browsers.mdx';

<CreateBrowserTimeout />
