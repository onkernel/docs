title: "Termination & Timeouts"

Kernel browsers should be terminated after you're done with them.

<Warning>
  Using Playwright/Puppeteer's method `browser.close()` does not delete the browser. Use one of the methods below to delete the browser. Calling `browser.close()` before deleting the Kernel browser will shut down Chromium, causing profile saving to fail.
</Warning>

## Deleting a browser via session ID

Every browser instance has a `session_id`. You can delete any browser using its session ID:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

await kernel.browsers.deleteByID('htzv5orfit78e1m2biiifpbv');
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()
kernel.browsers.delete_by_id("htzv5orfit78e1m2biiifpbv")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Automatic deletion via timeout

If you don't manually delete a browser, it will be automatically deleted after a configurable `timeout` (default 60 seconds). The timeout begins when the browser does not see a CDP or live view connection.

You can set a custom timeout of up to 72 hours when creating a browser:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const browser = await kernel.browsers.create({ timeout_seconds: 300 });
console.log(browser.session_id);
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()

browser = kernel.browsers.create(timeout_seconds=300)
print(browser.session_id)
```
</CodeGroup>
