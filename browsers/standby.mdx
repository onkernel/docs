title: "Standby Mode"
---

Kernel browsers enter standby mode during periods of inactivity. When a browser goes into standby mode, the browser's state remains the same but incurs zero usage costs.

Kernel browsers automatically enter standby when no CDP or Live View client is connected for `four seconds`. After it enters standby, the browser's [timeout](/browsers/termination#automatic-deletion-via-timeout) countdown begins.
