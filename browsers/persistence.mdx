title: "Persistence"
---

With Kernel, you can specify a browser to be persisted and then reuse that exact browser instance again over hours or days. Using [standby mode](/browsers/standby), we put the browser to sleep in between connections, so you don't pay for idle clock time.

Since we return the exact same browser instance upon subsequent connections, all browser state is preserved: web page, cookies, session auth, even the exact zoom settings on the page.

Persistence is especially useful for human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows, where automated steps and human actions may be separated by hours or days. The browser can be paused and reconnected without losing state, enabling multi-step processes that combine automation and manual intervention.

To specify a browser for persistence, specify its `persistence` settings in the `browsers.create()` method:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  persistence: {
    id: 'unique-browser-id-for-persistence'
  },
});
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()

kernel_browser = await kernel.browsers.create(
    persistence={
      "id": "unique-browser-id-for-persistence",
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

During runtime, Kernel will search for a browser with the specified `id`:

- If a browser with the specified `persistence id` is found, the existing browser will be returned.
- If a browser with the specified `persistence id` is _not_ found, a new browser instance will be created and assigned the specified `persistence id` for future reuse.
- Reusing an existing browser restores its exact state and stealth configurations. Stealth configs cannot be changed for an existing browser.

The browser's `persistence id` can be any string. You can set it to an identifier in your system to match it to a user, environment, website, or something else.

Persisted browsers exist indefinitely until you [delete them](/browsers/termination). See [here](/info/pricing) for plan limits on persistence.

<Info>
Use [Profiles](/browsers/profiles) if your goal is to reuse authentication state (cookies, local storage) across concurrent browsers. Persistence is best for human-in-the-loop (HITL) workflows where the same browser instance needs to be resumed later.
