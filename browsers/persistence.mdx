Persistence allows you to reuse a browser's state, including cookies, session auth, cache, and any other state that lives on a browser. This can be used to minimize CAPTCHAs and login flows.

Kernel's platform provides multiple ways to persist and reuse state and browser sessions.

## 1. Persisting a browser

With Kernel, you can specify a browser to be persisted and then reuse that exact browser instance again. Using [standby mode](/browsers/standby), we put the browser to sleep in between connections, so you don't pay for idle clock time.

Since we return the exact same browser instance upon subsequent connections, all browser state is preserved: web page, cookies, session auth, even the exact zoom settings on the page.

Persisted browsers exist indefinitely until you [delete them](/browsers/termination). See [here](/info/pricing) for plan limits on persistence.

To specify a browser for persistence, specify its `persistence` settings in the `browsers.create()` method:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
	persistence: { id: "unique-browser-id-for-persistence" },
});
```

```python Python
kernel_browser = await kernel.browsers.create(
	persistence={"id": "unique-browser-id-for-persistence"}
)
```

</CodeGroup>

During runtime, Kernel will search for a browser with the specified `id`:

- If a browser with the specified `persistence id` is found, the existing browser will be returned.
- If a browser with the specified `persistence id` is _not_ found, a new browser instance will be created and assigned the specified `persistence id` for future reuse.
- Reusing an existing browser restores its exact state and stealth configurationsâ€”stealth configs cannot be changed for an existing browser.

The browser's `persistence id` can be any string. You can set it to an identifier in your system to match it to a user, environment, website, or something else.
