title: "Headless Mode"
---

Kernel browsers ship in `Headful` mode by default. In Headful mode, the launched browser has a corresponding GUI. This enables features like [live view](/browsers/live-view) and [replays](/browsers/replays).

`Headless` mode runs without a visual interface. They generally run faster and have a lighter footprint (1 GB rather than headful's 8 GB), resulting in significant cost savings. This is useful for short-lived or highly concurrent browser automations.
Some bot detectors may detect headless mode.

To launch a Kernel browser in `Headless` mode, set its config:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript Typescript/Javascript
import Kernel from '@onkernel/sdk';

const kernel = new Kernel();

const kernelBrowser = await kernel.browsers.create({
  headless: true,
});
```

```python Python
from kernel import Kernel

kernel = Kernel()

kernel_browser = kernel.browsers.create(headless=True)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
    [Live View](/browsers/live-view) and [Replays](/browsers/replays) are not available in headless mode.
